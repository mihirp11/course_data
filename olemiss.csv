proper conduct of research involving human participants. Course topics
will include a brief historical review of ethics in science; a short
history of how we arrived at our current system of ethical oversight in
human subjects’ research; an examination of the codes, laws, and
regulations that address human subjects’ research. Throughout the
course, we will seek to understand ethical dimensions in scientific
inquiry. We will discuss the application and integration of ethical
principles in human subjects’ research – including ethics related to
experimental design, participant recruitment and the consent process,
management and access of scientific data, authorship and publication,
the scientists’ interaction with industry, dealing with conflicts of
interest, and emerging societal issues that result from new technology
and scientific advances. The purpose of this course is consistent with
the University of Mississippi Creed: ""The University of Mississippi is a
community of learning dedicated to nurturing excellence in intellectual
inquiry and personal character in an open and diverse environment. As a
voluntary member of this community, I believe in respect for the dignity
of each person. I believe in fairness and civility. I believe in
personal and professional integrity. I believe in academic honesty. I
believe in academic freedom. I believe in good stewardship of our
resources. I pledge to uphold these values and encourage others to
follow my example."" These noble tenets require thorough understanding
and wisdom in application as you engage in research with human

"Edec 610","Early Childhood Education and Care: Hist","Teacher Education","Child development theory and research have had a profound influence on
early childhood education and care (ECEC) policies, programs, and
services in the United States and internationally. In eight weeks (three
hours/week), this course provides an overview of the research on young
children (birth to age 5), demographics of this population, critical
domains of development, significance of early brain development, and
issues of inequality and disproportionality that deeply shape child
outcomes. It attempts to explore what develops in the first
years of life, why this period is so critical, what have been the
central questions that have driven both research and policy, whether
policies and research have helped to reduce inequality and advance
equity, and what critical issues are still unanswered (or even unasked).
The course familiarizes students with the cultural ideas, beliefs,
values, and social purposes that have shaped and continue to influence
children and families in the United States. Further, the course presents
research from a range of disciplines (e.g., psychology,
sociology, education, neuroscience, economics) to help students
understand the complexity of developmental factors relevant to ECEC
policy development and program design. The goals of the course are to
help students understand the importance of early development, the
critical need to develop ECEC policies grounded in research and
practice, and the effectiveness and limitations of ECEC
policies to address fundamental issues of inequality. Finally, the
course is intended to enable students to place their own professional
interests and concerns in a broader historical and educational context.","3 Credits","https://catalog.olemiss.edu/education/teacher-education/edec-610","School of Education","Teacher Education"
"Edec 611","Early Childhood Education and Care Today","Teacher Education","With increasing attention accorded to the practices and policies
affecting young children and their families, this course provides an in-
depth understanding of the forces that shape and the issues that
confront contemporary early childhood education and care (ECEC) in the
United States. Designed for those interested in advancing their general
knowledge of the status of ECEC, the course addresses contextual and
historical variables that have affected its evolution in the
United States. Within this framework, the course sits at the
intersection of adapted theory and applied science, and provides a
thorough overview of the pedagogy, practices, policies, and issues
framing the design and delivery of contemporary ECEC. Central to such
formulations, the role of parents and families is addressed as a
critical contouring variable. Designed in three units, the course
addresses: (i) understanding early childhood education and
care practice and policy in the United States; (ii) identifying critical
policy challenges; and (iii) addressing critical policy challenges.","3 Credits","https://catalog.olemiss.edu/education/teacher-education/edec-611","School of Education","Teacher Education"
"Edec 612","Early Childhood Education & Care Policy","Teacher Education","This course provides an interdisciplinary perspective on early childhood
education and care (ECEC) policy, focusing on the systematic study,
analysis, and interpretation of policy. The course is designed to help
students understand the role that research plays throughout the policy
process, learn the main tools used in policy analysis, and to explore
different theoretical frames that can be used to interpret and influence
current ECEC policy discourse. The purpose of the course is to equip
students to critically structure a policy problem, as well as to examine
and analyze the design, implementation, and outcomes of various
policies. Any given policy (or set of policies) will engender
conflicting evidence and even competing meta-narratives about what it is
intended to accomplish. For example, universal pre-K can be seen as an
equity tool and as an attempt to ""school-ify"" early learning.","3 Credits","https://catalog.olemiss.edu/education/teacher-education/edec-612","School of Education","Teacher Education"
"Edec 613","Early Childhood Education and Care Today","Teacher Education","In the United States, early childhood education and care (ECEC) is
heavily influenced by the government through the fiscal investments made
and the regulations that are applied to those programmatic and workforce
investments.  Always important, the nature of and approach to
governmental policymaking are instrumental to the delivery of quality
and equitable services for young children. But as the sector expands and
builds on its extant services and programs (e.g., Head Start and Early
Head Start, the Child Care and Development Block Grant, state-funded
pre-Kindergarten, Part C and Part B of IDEA early intervention),
critical new issues come to the fore: How to handle increasing
investments in ways that evoke quality and equity? How to forge
meaningful services among federal, state, and community investments and
regulations? How to forge a strategic policy agenda? How to develop
effective advocates and policy leaders? How to enjoin diverse entities
and players to create an effective system of services for young children
and their families? And how to marshal external players, including the
communications, research, and policy communities? To address these
issues, this course is designed to focus on: (i) the practice and
process of policymaking; (ii) the practice of policy advocacy; and (iii)
leadership and ethics.","3 Credits","https://catalog.olemiss.edu/education/teacher-education/edec-613","School of Education","Teacher Education"

welfare policy. It exposes students to numerous types of policy-related
research including social problem assessment, comparative research,
historical research, implementation research, and numerous types of
qualitative and quantitative outcome-related research. Policies related
to the problem of poverty have been selected as the content focus of
this class since this issue is especially salient in the state of
Mississippi and for many social work clients internationally. By
analyzing and critiquing numerous types of research
related to policy, students will learn the many ways research influences
policy and begin to define their roles as researchers in social work, a
policy-based profession.","3 Credits","https://catalog.olemiss.edu/applied-sciences/social-work/sw-709","School of Applied Sciences","Social Work"

"SW 711","Qualitative Methods in Social Work Resea","Social Work","The purpose of this class is to introduce students to the theories,
assumptions, and practices underlying the use of qualitative research in
social work. In the tradition of survey courses, this class examines the
broad history, concepts, and themes that distinguish multiple methods of
qualitative research, specifically as they relate to social work
research. Students will study, practice, and reflect on different
qualitative research methodologies and consider the components and
challenges faced when engaging in qualitative research methods. Each
student will design and conduct his/her own qualitative
study using ethnography. Issues related to data collection, negotiating
access to the field, ethics, and representation will be of particular
importance.  While it is not assumed that students will gain a
comprehensive understanding of all qualitative research traditions over
the trajectory of the course, it is expected that, upon completion,
students will acquire the foundational knowledge and experience to begin
evaluating, selecting, and defending appropriate ethnographic methods
for use in their own research projects.","3 Credits","https://catalog.olemiss.edu/applied-sciences/social-work/sw-711","School of Applied Sciences","Social Work"
"SW 712","Advanced Statistics in Social Work","Social Work","This course will cover a wide range of research situations that require
longitudinal and mediation analyses, comparisons between groups, and
analyses that include data from multiple sources such as from parents,
teachers, and children. The course will focus on using the Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) analyses, a widespread approach that gained
popularity from the early '80s. SEM merges confirmatory factor analysis
with path analysis and provides means for constructing, testing, and
comparing comprehensive structural path models as well as comparing the
goodness of fit of models and their adequacy across multiple groups
(samples). Among other advantages of SEM over the traditional
path analysis is that it provides adjustment for the relative
unreliability of the observed measures, overall goodness of fit
measures, and tests for comparing models. Without adjustment for
reliability, results from traditional path analyses confound the
substantive contribution of predictors with their relative
methodological strength as indicated by their reliabilities. This
confounding may lead to seriously flawed conclusions in the
interpretation of the results.  This course will cover the conceptual
and technical issues relevant to the application of Structural Equation
Modeling. Following the presentation of major conceptual issues, five
basic structural models will be described in detail. The models vary
from simple to more complex ones. The description and discussion of the
models will provide students with the knowledge and skills to
apply SEM techniques using Stata software for analyzing, evaluating, and
reporting results produced by this analytic method. This knowledge is
easily transferable to the use of EQS, LISREL, or AMOS software. Course
work will require the students to construct and test a structural model
using their own data or data from available data sets and produce a
paper reporting their analysis.","3 Credits","https://catalog.olemiss.edu/applied-sciences/social-work/sw-712","School of Applied Sciences","Social Work"
