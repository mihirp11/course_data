Broadly speaking, the course follows a traditional “levels of analysis” structure, beginning with the systemic or structural level, where the course examines constraints on foreign-policy making such as balance of power considerations and alliance structures. The course also considers systemic sources of foreign policy, including transnational social networks, multi-national corporations, diasporas, epistemic communities, global norms, and the democratic peace. The course then moves to the state level to investigate the influence of domestic factors such as regime type, government veto players, bureaucratic and organizational politics, sub-state interest groups, public opinion and media, as well as cultural factors. Finally, the course moves to individual-level factors that influence foreign policy decision-making, including cognitive maps, leadership traits, psychological factors, perceptions, and beliefs. The course focuses largely on US foreign policy, as the FPA literature is largely U.S.-based. However, we will also examine foreign policy-making in the EU, China, Japan, Russia, as well as small or weak states.   Cross Listing(s): INTS 4132  .
