"AMS523","The Roots of American Music","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This class surveys American music from ragtime, blues, and hillbilly to Broadway, Hollywood musicals, and swing jazz. Our focus will be on commercial mainstreams and democratic audiences – how selling sound led to different identities being expressed through taste and style. Race, gender, class, sexuality, age, technology, and the music business will all factor as we move from blackface minstrelsy in the 1800s to World War II. We will listen closely to several songs each week, connecting music to larger themes through primary and secondary sources, regular writing, and in-class discussion. "
"AMS529","American between the Wars","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This course examines a crucial period in the modern American experience beginning with the end of one world war and ending with the beginning of another.  Adjusting to modernity required Americans to square old values with new departures, something that makes this period more than merely two decades linked by the calendar and the Stock Market Crash.  Top to bottom, between 1919 and 1941, Americans redefined themselves and their society, embraced (some of them) and debated (nearly all of them), often hotly, old beliefs, new conceptions, and the implications of a modern, machine-driven, consumer society.  What they argued over then, is what is still argued over, issues and assertions students should find very familiar.  Students will look closely at this debate from its origins in post-war prosperity and its evolution through Great Depression scarcity, paying particular attention to such crucial issues as Modernism, consumerism, the growth of American national culture, and the influence of commercialized forms of popular expression on everyday lives and values. "

Course readings include classical scholars in urbanism and urban design. Contemporary urban environmental histories explore population shifts and land use along the urban gradient from the suburbs to urban centers, with attention to water, sewer, and transportation infrastructure, pollution, and urban sprawl. "
"AMS545","The ""Good War""","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","In popular memory, then and since, it is, say many, the defining moment of the twentieth century, perhaps all the American experience.  Between 1941 and 1945, the American people waged global war, an undertaking of unprecedented scale and urgency.  After Pearl Harbor, the national will stiffened and at least for the duration, the story goes, Americans forgot their differences, rallied to the cause, and through their collective suffering and sacrifice saved the world.   This was not just a necessary war; it was a good war fought against a palpable evil in a world reduced to rival spheres of right and wrong whose only acceptable end, “victory,” justified any means however extreme.  Virtue abroad, cohesion at home, and prosperity in the marketplace, the war united all three in a way previous Americans had only dreamed about and never achieved before or since.  Small wonder, then, that over the years since 1945, in a world less simple and a society more divided, the memory of World War II has hardened into myth, the golden, “feel good”  moment of rectitude, shared sacrifice, and uncomplicated moral triumph.  This course is very much about that moment and the myth it established.  Please note, it is not a military history of the Second World War, replete with situation maps, production figures, and casualty reports.  It is instead a topical examination of the American experience at home and abroad, 1941-45.  It focuses critically on five related subjects, each providing ample opportunity to examine the myth and memory of “Good War America,” this pivotal moment in national and global history. "
"AMS565","Fictions of American Identity","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This course explores nineteenth- and twentieth-century American literature and culture. Novels and short stories by Zora Neale Hurston, Henry James, Gish Jen, James Weldon Johnson, Toni Morrison, Vladimir Nabokov, and other writers are studied in the context of debates over slavery, national identity, women’s roles, immigration and assimilation, social mobility, sexual mores, consumer culture, and race relations.

It will examine how viewing the body as a biocultural canvas and looking at culture as “lived through” the materiality of the body influences our understandings of health and health care. Students will be challenged to examine health as a concept that is quantifiable and generalizable as well experiential and person-centered. They will be challenged to view the discipline of medicine as a framework for employing verifiable and shared (or questionable and contested) knowledge of biological systems whose foundational assumptions and core meanings are grounded in particular social and cultural worlds. "
"ANT507","Psychological Anthropology","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","In this course, we review three main models of research within psychological anthropology: psychodynamic, cognitive, and experiential/phenomenological. We also gain a comprehensive understanding of person-centered ethnography, which involves in-depth interviews designed to reveal individuals’ self-perceptions and experiences in relation to the sociocultural context. Students gain practice in this methodology by conducting a series of interviews over the course of the semester. "
"ANT509","Ancient Maya Civilizations","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","What was the lived daily experience in the pre-contact Maya world? How did aspects of material culture such as architecture, food, musical instruments, tools, and clothing frame Maya society, and how were these elements also framed by it? How are perceptions of the ancient Maya marshaled in today’s politics and policies? In this course, we will engage with the world of the pre- and post-contact Maya, through scholarship that explores the material culture of daily life. The course is arranged around framing questions about the past through ethnographic and ethnohistoric accounts of daily life; using diverse scientific methods and theoretical perspectives to address these questions; and interpreting and possibly re-interpreting daily life of the ancient Maya, focusing on the dynamic interplay between the material and the social. "

Cross-cultural ethnographic examples—including a range of religious, spiritual, and magical belief systems—will be provided to illuminate how anthropologists analyze belief systems in their interpretations of culture. "
"ANT521","Ethnography","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Ethnography is a hallmark of anthropology. It is at once a theoretical approach, set of methods, and style of writing. This course highlights ethnographic theory, methods for collecting ethnographic material, and techniques for writing about culture by reading exemplary texts, discussing key concepts, and practicing various methods. Each student will develop an ethnographic project that involves fieldwork, data analysis, and writing. "
"ANT522","Archaeological Ethics","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Students all encounter dilemmas in their everyday lives. Oftentimes, these situations do not present a clear solution, forcing us to ponder the morals and codes we live by and the manner in which we attempt to present logical responses to ethical conundrums. The field of archaeology may, at first, seem like an odd candidate for discussion of ethics given that it studies past peoples. Students will learn that archaeology is indeed heavily situated in the present and has many ties to such subjects as identity, notions of nationhood and nation-building, collective memory, and historical revision. This class will explore the legal and ethical dimensions of modern archaeology through a consideration of the archaeology as a profession, professional codes on archaeological ethics, the relationship between archaeology and others (the public, ethnic groups, collectors, etc.), international and national approaches to archaeological heritage management, the antiquities trade, maritime law, underwater archaeology, and treasure hunting, cultural resource management in the United States, and archaeological education. "
"ANT523","Legal Anthropology","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","What is law? Do all societies have it? Is there really something distinct about “thinking like a lawyer”? This seminar primarily draws on anthropological studies of legal systems and practices to show that the answers to these questions are surprisingly complex.

"
"ANT527","Radiocarbon for Archaeologists","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Radiocarbon (AMS 14C) dating is the most commonly used dating method in archaeological research. The purpose of this class is to gain a deep understanding of radiocarbon so that we, as archaeologists, can better sample/collect, calibrate, and analyze these data for our own research, and critically evaluate the scholarly literature. We will further our understanding of radiocarbon and its archaeological applications through course lectures, presentations and discussions of the recent literature, calculation and calibration activities, and individual research projects. This course has relevancy for any student interested in field archaeology, as it will train them to collect appropriate samples for dating and design dating strategies that are consistent with their research goals.

"PSC613","State Politics and Policy","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","In this course we will examine theories and related research on state government and the policymaking process in the U.S. states. The course is divided into three parts. For approximately the first third of the semester, we will examine a fairly representative set of readings which span a broad range of political institutions through which policy is made. These institutions include the office of the governor, the state legislature, the state judicial system, and the various practices of direct democracy across the states. Part two of the course will be spent studying theories of the state policy process. We will examine a variety of theories, reflecting a broad range of forces that are thought to play a significant role in shaping state policy outcomes. As we will see, despite the complex and seemingly idiosyncratic nature of the policymaking process,   state politics scholars have identified many systematic relationships between various institutional and contextual variables, and state policy outcomes. The insights that have been generated from this literature not only contribute to our understanding of state policymaking, but in many cases they shed light on debates that are relevant to scholars of American (national) politics, or in some cases, comparative politics. In the final section of the course, we will examine research in several substantive policy areas which have traditionally been considered the domain of the states. Our emphasis in this section will be broadened to include not just studies of policy adoption, but studies of policy implementation and impact as well. "
"PSC614","Race and American Politics","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Despite the passage of the Civil Rights Act (1964) and the Voting Rights Act (1965) fifty years ago, and the recent election of an African American president in 2008, racial inequality persists across many dimensions of American life, including earnings, wealth, educational and occupational attainment, health and longevity, and access to political power and influence. Despite claims of a “post-racial” America, the events in Ferguson, Missouri and the recent movement that they have sparked, serve to remind us that racial inequality and its impact on race relations continue to play a central role in American politics. Today, African Americans and Latinos comprise approximately a quarter of the U.S. population. In many cities and some states, white Anglo citizens actually comprise a minority of the population, and demographic projections over the next two decades suggest that the white share of the population will continue to    decline. Thus, it seems clear that race relations will remain central to understanding American politics at all levels of government in the years to come.  In this course we will examine theories and related research on the role of race relations and racial stratification in American politics. The course is divided into four major sections. The first section of the course examines theories of racial prejudice. In this section we will examine some of the most important debates in the literature, including the possible existence and precise definition of a “new racism,” innovations regarding the measurement of prejudice to overcome social desirability bias, and the effects of increasing diversity on racial attitudes and race relations. In part two of the course we will examine the effects of racial attitudes on political behavior. We will examine the effects of race and prejudice on vote choice, the role of racial attitudes in the growth and success of the Republic Party in the South in recent decades, racial framing effects and the effects of the use of racial “code words” in campaigns and the mass media, and the role that racial attitudes have played in evaluations of and support for Barack Obama. In part three of the course, we turn out attention to the causes and consequences of the election of minority elected officials. What factors contribute to the success of black and Latino candidates in elections? And what difference does it make? In this section we will examine the debate over the importance of minority descriptive representation in advancing minority interests, as well as the effects of the increasing diversification of elected officials on other aspects of American politics. In the final section of the course, we will examine the importance of race in the policy process. We begin by examining theories and evidence of the influence of race relations in policy design and policy adoption. We then turn our attention to the importance of race in policy implementation and policy outcomes. "

"PSC643","International Relations Theory (I): Realism","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This is the first of a series of two seminars on the core ""traditions"" of international theory.  ""Traditions"" means a series of loosely connected ontological, epistemological and normative propositions: claims as to what the world is made of, how it can be understood, and what the work of scholarship could or should be.  These propositions are interwoven in a variety of ways that make them hard to unravel.  They are made even more so by the fact that they are intercut with a variety of different methodologies to form highly disparate research programs.  Core concepts and testable propositions meld with background beliefs and lived experiences to structure our thinking in ways that can be hard to see. "
"PSC645","International Relations Theory (II): IR-Liberalism","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This is the second of a series of seminars on the core ""traditions"" of international theory. ""Traditions"" means a series of loosely connected ontological, epistemological and normative propositions: claims as to what the world is made of, how it can be understood, and what the work of scholarship should be.  These propositions are interwoven in a variety of ways that make them hard to unravel.  They are made even more so by the fact that they are intercut with a variety of different methodologies to form highly disparate research programs.  As a result, what we think of as ‘IR-liberalism’ cannot be studied as a series of simple and testable propositions, nor as simply the extension of a consensus body of philosophical or political principles into the field of world politics.

This field works to decolonize the contested terrain of knowledge production upon gendered subjectivites are constituted and reconstituted within global relations of power and privilege.  While globalization relies upon the heightened mobility of bodies, capital, commodities, technologies, and conceptual imaginaries across borders, it simultaneously requires the reconfiguration and reconstitution of the state, its bordering practices, and colonial and national hierarchies of social-spatial relations and their attendant binaries—self-other, first world-third world, traditional-modern, private-public, citizen-noncitizen. While a richly theoretical field, transnational feminisms provocatively engages with a feminist politics and practice attentive to feminism as both a liberatory formation and one with longstanding ties to colonialism, racism and imperialism. As such, it resists utopic ideas about ""global sisterhood"" while simultaneously working to lay the groundwork for more productive and equitable social relations among women across borders and cultural contexts.
