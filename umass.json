Machine learning combines insights from artificial intelligence, probability theory, statistical inference, and information theory to help automate tasks involving pattern recognition, prediction, and classification. &quot;Learning&quot; is analogous to &quot;inference&quot; in statistics and, in fact, the modern statistical toolkit includes various machine learning methods developed to handle large (and messy) datasets. The course focuses on statistical learning and is a good second or third course in statistical methods for graduate students in the social and behavioral sciences. We will examine key techniques of supervised and unsupervised learning and reflect upon appropriate and inappropriate applications of such approaches for those seeking to understand the social world. We shall also discuss the ethical issues involved in automated analysis and computer-assisted decision-making, including how they may in some cases help overcome human biases and in others instead only serve to reinforce these tendencies.",

Under what conditions do they change (or not)? What are the network outcomes individuals get based on their structural positions and roles? How do information and resources move from one spot to another within and beyond networks? Where does the flow stop? What are the mechanisms that lead to changes to networks? Do people form (or dissolve) social relations because of shared similarities (or outright differences) with others, or because they tend to be influenced by others already in their networks? Extending the discussion on descriptive and structural characteristics of network data in Social Network Analysis (DACSS 695N), this course introduces statistical frameworks with which network dynamics can be investigated. Recapitulating issues that make it hard to marry conventional frameworks for statistical inference with network data, such as autocorrelation and relational dependency, this course starts with mathematical models that utilize some mechanisms of network formation and continues on to statistical models. In particular, this course introduces some well-known statistical network models such as exponential random graph models (ERGMs), network regression models, latent space models, and stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOMs), as well as models that consider temporality in statistical frameworks such as temporal exponential random graph models (TERGMs) and diffusion in networks.",

        "title": "The Undead Souths: Southern Gothic and Francophone Mythologies in Film &amp; Television",
        "term": "1253",
        "type": "course",
        "description": "This course will explore themes of the Southern Gothic in works of Cinema and popular Televisual narratives. We will study the development of the lurid motifs of the Gothic that works affiliated with this genre often deploy to invoke a sense of horror and dread, moral corruption, and psychological abjection, all seemingly meant to assimilate the South and its citizens to the category of a degenerate and menacing otherness. The imagery of dismal landscapes, dark swamps, decaying architecture, fanatical and occult religious practices, and the often grotesque or monstrous figures and cultural tropes that aspire to associate the South with an imaginary medieval past, will be examined mostly as marks of an ambivalent ideological struggle surrounding the self-identity of America. Thanks to this regime of gothic tropes and insignia, America, on the one hand, heralds its own self-identity as culturally rich and historically continuous, and yet, it is, at least partly thanks to this same regimen of gothic tropes (understood as figures of otherness), on the other hand, that America also typically (or stereotypically) deals with anxieties arising from its attempts to define its own modern identity, and its identity as modern and exceptional. Such anxieties give rise to instances of negative stereotyping, and practices of cultural exclusion that the course critically interrogates. We also study several important ways in which the Gothic serves as an important voice for the marginalized, while enabling critical reflections on the social and cultural practices of exclusion we have alluded to. The history of slavery, the civil war, and its aftermath, as well as literature produced by certain Southern writers (such as William Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, Carson McCullers, Flannery O&#039;Connor, Eudora Welty, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Katherine Anne Porter, and others) since the late 19th century, will be identified as important defining contexts of emergence for the Southern gothic, and as the indispensable conditions that have made its deployment into 20th century film and television possible. Due attention will also be paid to the influence of French colonial adventures and interventions in shaping cultures and &quot;gothic&quot; mythologies of the American South, and the Caribbean, as well as the role played by America&#039;s own efforts to secure and maintain hegemonic influences on the region. The course is conducted in English, and requires no prior knowledge of the field. All films are streamed to your computer from the UMass library on demand. Required readings are provided online, and no book purchases are necessary. (Gen. Ed. AT, DU)",

The course familiarizes students with strategies for cross-cultural communication, conflict resolution and organizational capacity building that center on cultural humility - essential knowledge and skills for future legal practitioners, policy makers, public service leaders, and community actors. Cultural humility is the &quot;ability to maintain an interpersonal stance that is other-oriented (or open to the other) in relation to aspects of cultural identity that are most important to&quot; the individual or group (Hook et al., 2013). Through a combination of readings, class activities, group discussions, and continuous reflection, students examine ways of applying cultural humility to law, policy, and practice with a view to securing the inclusion of and justice for people of all identities in an increasingly diversifying and globalizing society. This course has two major learning components: classroom learning and community service learning. Students will therefore reflect, throughout the semester, on the connections between course content and their internship sites.

How have power issues of gender, class, and colonialism shaped people&#039;s access to food? How has industrialization changed food, and where are foodways headed in the future? Along the way, students will read and see films about foodways in Europe, Africa, Asia, the United States, and Latin America. (Gen. Ed. SB, DG)",

Central to this concern is the idea that culture plays a central role in definitions of health and illness. After establishing a base for examining and defining medical anthropology, as well as taking a look at health, illness, and medicine within a range of different cultures, we will take a closer look at health issues in North America. There will also be particular emphasis on the diversity (plurality) of therapeutic and philosophical approaches to the body and medicine, and how these are culturally infused and reflective. This latter point will involve a critical analysis of biomedicine and various alternative therapies currently in practice in North America.",

This course will draw from across the social sciences to demonstrate the ways in which qualitative and quantitative research can be used to complement one another to potentially yield more comprehensive, thorough results and identify how research questions can both drive and be driven by our methodologies. Students will learn to situate themselves in their research, explore ethical concerns within qualitative research, and consider how bias, power differentials, and their own life experiences can impact their research.",

        "type": "course",
        "description": "This course will explore themes of the Southern Gothic in works of Cinema and popular Televisual narratives. We will study the development of the lurid motifs of the Gothic that works affiliated with this genre often deploy to invoke a sense of horror and dread, moral corruption, and psychological abjection, all seemingly meant to assimilate the South and its citizens to the category of a degenerate and menacing otherness. The imagery of dismal landscapes, dark swamps, decaying architecture, fanatical and occult religious practices, and the often grotesque or monstrous figures and cultural tropes that aspire to associate the South with an imaginary medieval past, will be examined mostly as marks of an ambivalent ideological struggle surrounding the self-identity of America. Thanks to this regime of gothic tropes and insignia, America, on the one hand, heralds its own self-identity as culturally rich and historically continuous, and yet, it is, at least partly thanks to this same regimen of gothic tropes (understood as figures of otherness), on the other hand, that America also typically (or stereotypically) deals with anxieties arising from its attempts to define its own modern identity, and its identity as modern and exceptional. Such anxieties give rise to instances of negative stereotyping, and practices of cultural exclusion that the course critically interrogates. We also study several important ways in which the Gothic serves as an important voice for the marginalized, while enabling critical reflections on the social and cultural practices of exclusion we have alluded to. The history of slavery, the civil war, and its aftermath, as well as literature produced by certain Southern writers (such as William Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, Carson McCullers, Flannery O&#039;Connor, Eudora Welty, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Katherine Anne Porter, and others) since the late 19th century, will be identified as important defining contexts of emergence for the Southern gothic, and as the indispensable conditions that have made its deployment into 20th century film and television possible. Due attention will also be paid to the influence of French colonial adventures and interventions in shaping cultures and &quot;gothic&quot; mythologies of the American South, and the Caribbean, as well as the role played by America&#039;s own efforts to secure and maintain hegemonic influences on the region. The course is conducted in English, and requires no prior knowledge of the field. All films are streamed to your computer from the UMass library on demand. Required readings are provided online, and no book purchases are necessary. (Gen. Ed. AT, DU)",

How do we explore, through literature, the substance behind the stereotypical association of love, romance, and sexual pleasure with French culture? Do sex, passion, and love always unite in the pursuit of emotional fulfillment in human relations, according to this literature? What affiliations does this literature interweave between such relations of love, requited or unrequited, and pleasure, enjoyment, freedom, self-empowerment, on the one hand, and on the other hand, suffering, jealousy, crime, violence, negativity, notions of perversion, morbidity, and even death? How are problems of gender roles and human sexuality?i.e. Hetero-, bi-, homo- and other forms of sexuality--approached in this literature? What connections or conflicts are revealed in this literature between human love relationships and the social norms and conventions within which they occur, as well as the forms of political governance that have been practiced in France over the centuries? Those are some of the issues that are investigated in this course, which offers a broad historical overview of selective ways in which love, passion, desire and erotic behavior in French culture have been represented and understood in Literature and, more recently, in film, from the middle ages to the twentieth century. Readings are from major French authors drawn from various centuries such as Marie de France, Beroul, Moliere, de Sade, Flaubert, Gide, and Duras.

        "type": "course",
        "description": "This course will explore themes of the Southern Gothic in works of Cinema and popular Televisual narratives. We will study the development of the lurid motifs of the Gothic that works affiliated with this genre often deploy to invoke a sense of horror and dread, moral corruption, and psychological abjection, all seemingly meant to assimilate the South and its citizens to the category of a degenerate and menacing otherness. The imagery of dismal landscapes, dark swamps, decaying architecture, fanatical and occult religious practices, and the often grotesque or monstrous figures and cultural tropes that aspire to associate the South with an imaginary medieval past, will be examined mostly as marks of an ambivalent ideological struggle surrounding the self-identity of America. Thanks to this regime of gothic tropes and insignia, America, on the one hand, heralds its own self-identity as culturally rich and historically continuous, and yet, it is, at least partly thanks to this same regimen of gothic tropes (understood as figures of otherness), on the other hand, that America also typically (or stereotypically) deals with anxieties arising from its attempts to define its own modern identity, and its identity as modern and exceptional. Such anxieties give rise to instances of negative stereotyping, and practices of cultural exclusion that the course critically interrogates. We also study several important ways in which the Gothic serves as an important voice for the marginalized, while enabling critical reflections on the social and cultural practices of exclusion we have alluded to. The history of slavery, the civil war, and its aftermath, as well as literature produced by certain Southern writers (such as William Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, Carson McCullers, Flannery O&#039;Connor, Eudora Welty, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Katherine Anne Porter, and others) since the late 19th century, will be identified as important defining contexts of emergence for the Southern gothic, and as the indispensable conditions that have made its deployment into 20th century film and television possible. Due attention will also be paid to the influence of French colonial adventures and interventions in shaping cultures and &quot;gothic&quot; mythologies of the American South, and the Caribbean, as well as the role played by America&#039;s own efforts to secure and maintain hegemonic influences on the region.

Crucial to doing and understanding philosophy is an ability to present, explain, and evaluate arguments; throughout the course we will refine these abilities. By way of an introduction to a number of core philosophical issues we will take an in-depth look at one of the greatest works of philosophy of all time, Descartes&#039;s Meditations on First Philosophy. In it we will encounter skeptical arguments, arguments for the existence of God, and an argument for mind-body dualism. We will grapple with these issues in addition to questions about free will and ethics. (Gen. Ed. AL)",

What are our obligations to animals? Is affirmative action permissible? What bearing does implicit bias have on ethical hiring practices? Should governments such as the United States pay reparations? But we will also look at proposals to give unified answers to all moral questions. Inevitably, we will pause to reflect on the moral questions themselves: What are we asking for when we ask whether something is morally wrong? Is it reasonable to expect a fully general answer to those questions? What makes for a `correct? answer to moral questions? We will not focus on giving particular answers to specific moral questions, but rather on learning how to give reasons for or against such answers. In addition to introducing you to the major moral theories and giving you some tools to answer specific moral questions, our goal will thus be to sharpen your ability to analyze, evaluate, and craft your own philosophical arguments.

On the one hand, the fuzziness of knowledge and fact production can make it difficult to tell what is objective fact and what is said purely for private/personal gain; on the other hand, human cognition tends to lead us down paths of confirmation bias, making the determination of reality doubly difficult. We do not want to be stepped on. We want to be affirmed, so that we can have a sense of worth and contentedness. When trouble strikes, though, where do we turn to for explanation and meaning? Are things really as they appear, or is something else out there? Who benefits from conflicted or chaotic moments, and why is it not us?",

We will typically work from the perspective of the advocate, leader, or public servant trying to get things done and to increase public value or the public good. The course challenges students to analyze actual case studies of innovation, promising practices and serious challenges that public servants and public managers face. Course topics cover a broad and emerging terrain including public engagement and participation, open government and open data, visualization and mapping, multistakeholder collaboration, cross-boundary networks, design thinking, agile development, smart cities and the future of work. The course and discussions are as concerned with managing change, preserving democracy, and reducing inequality as they are with introducing ?cutting edge? ideas. In a domain chock full of hype and extravagant promises, you should leave the course better equipped to see through the hype, to evaluate the feasibility of several digital innovations, and to examine unintended consequences of digitization related to increasing inequalities and biases. Course materials include case studies, reports and other practical writing in addition to research articles. Students will be expected to co-produce materials for themselves and their peers in the class to deepen knowledge of their particular interests and to participate actively in building the learning community that will constitute our class.",
