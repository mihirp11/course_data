"(ENT) Entrepreneurship","ENT 464","Corporate Entrepreneurship","Management guru Peter Drucker argues that entrepreneurship is the lifeblood of business; without entrepreneurship, all organizations will eventually find themselves out of business. In today’s world, companies are struggling to lower costs, increase quality, and offer better customer service, while also being faster, more flexible, more aggressive, more innovative, and more connected. These are difficult tasks, but necessary for businesses to maintain their competitive edge. Yet, few people really understand how to make this happen. That is where this course fits in. It is about understanding how and why some firms can maintain their entrepreneurial spirit, competitiveness, and growth, whereas others are not. It is about creating work environments where innovation is the norm, where employees are encouraged to work entrepreneurially, where leadership is supportive (not controlling), and where firms are organized to take advantage of all the good things that its people do. This course will be one of many questions, issues, examples, and controversies. Students will be expected to develop and defend their opinions, to independently search for what the ‘best companies’ do, and to suggest how others can do better.

Acquiring and balancing limited resources, changing direction quickly, building a coherent team, developing an organization’s culture from scratch, managing intellectual property, and creating new markets all test a wide range of managerial skills not usually demanded in one person within a larger organization. Whereas a large company has a strong and well-defined structure and ample resources to deal with unexpected challenges, a start-up usually has insufficient resources and/or management experience, yet it must deal on a daily basis with important and often unpredictable forces.Students will be exposed to these tensions and experience through problem-based learning methods that illustrate what it is like to start and grow a new company. The course will provide students with the knowledge and experience to increase their likelihood of success whether as a principal in a small company or an investor representative.Managing a Startup is a problem-based learning (PBL) course, where the learning is student-centered, with faculty acting primarily in the role of facilitators. Active learning happens in this course because students are engaged in the analysis of the complex situations that underlie startup companies.
