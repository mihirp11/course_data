Master teachers in AUTeach are instructors and are chosen for their experience and success in secondary classrooms. They provide candidates direct exposure to people who love teaching and view it as a rewarding career choice. Mentor teachers at the schools where candidates teach their prepared lessons demonstrate effective teaching techniques and classroom management skills, giving the future teachers a true taste of working in a supportive, diverse educational setting.
