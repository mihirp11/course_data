Care Crisis: Late Medieval Vulnerabilities,FRENCH 104,FAS,Romance Languages & Lit,"In the period known as the long fourteenth century, the French kingdom and its people suffered unprecedented violence, corruption, and loss. Imbricating vulnerabilities exposed by plague, the Hundred Years’ war, civil war, pillaging, famine, mental illness, and greed created anincreasingly untenable crisis of care. Equally unprecedented was the sensitivity of late medieval literary writers to these events. Far from serving as mouthpieces to the powerful or entertainers who distract from reality,"

Death and Immortality,FYSEMR 30Q,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"In this seminar, we will discuss philosophical questions about death and immortality. What is death? Is there a moral difference between ""brain death"" and the irreversible loss of consciousness? Is the classification of a person as dead a moral judgment, or is it an entirely scientific matter? Is death a misfortune to the person who dies? How can death be a misfortune if you are no longer around to experience that misfortune? Is it possible to survive after death? What does it mean for"
Skepticism and Knowledge,FYSEMR 31J,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Descartes wrote his Meditations because he realized that, although he had received the best education in the world, much of what he had learned was false or unfounded.  This led him to embark on a systematic investigation to discover whether knowledge is possible.  Harvard freshmen face a similar predicament. Having dutifully learned what they were taught, and evidently learned it well, some find themselves questioning its cognitive adequacy.  Much that they learned in school seem"
Trials from Classical Athens and Modern Legal Debates,FYSEMR 31P,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"In classical Athens, litigants represented themselves before hundreds of jurors who rendered verdicts without instruction from a judge. We will evaluate Athens’ distinctively amateur legal system by reading surviving court speeches involving homicide, assault, adultery, international law, and commerce as well as Plato’s account of Socrates’ defense speech. We will analyze the speeches as pieces of legal rhetoric and for the insight they offer into ancient approaches to crime an"
Complexity in Works of Art: Ulysses and Hamlet,FYSEMR 33X,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Is the complexity, the imperfection, the difficulty of interpretation, the unresolved meaning found in certain great and lasting works of literary art a result of technical experimentation?  Or is the source extreme complexity—psychological, metaphysical, or spiritual?  Does it result from limits within language, or from language’s fit to thought and perception?  Do the inherited forms found in literature permit only certain variations within experience to reach lucidi"

To prepare for each book dis"
"History, Nationalism, and the World: The Case of Korea",FYSEMR 43W,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"This seminar will explore the quandary that faces all historians:  To what extent is the understanding of past episodes influenced by current politics and to what extent is current politics influenced by people’s understanding of the past?  In the study of Korean history, this question is particularly sharp since the postcolonial division of Korea into North and South has thrust the memory of past events into current political discussions as well as scholarly debates.  The s"
Declarations of Independence: The Political Philosophy of the American Revolution,FYSEMR 47U,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"As the 250th anniversary of the US Declaration of Independence approaches in 2026, this seminar will examine that familiar document in some unfamiliar contexts.

Measurements of the Mind: The Creation and Critique of the Psychological Test,FYSEMR 49N,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"For well over a century, psychologists have worked with schools, corporations, immigration officers, the military, and psychiatrists to sort the American population into groups in order to make a number of key judgments.

Life and Death Lessons from the Fossil Record,FYSEMR 52L,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"The fossil record offers a unique perspective on the history of Life on Earth. Although palaeontology might remind us of grotesque bones, dusty museum cabinets, and quirky scientists who relish both of those things—or God forbid, Ross Geller from Friends­—the knowledge derived from the fossil record affects our daily lives in ways that are not immediately apparent. From its natural history origins during the 19th century, paleontology has become a cornerstone of neo-Darwinian evo"

Students will learn how to visualize and summarize data usi"
Literature of Spiritual Crisis,FYSEMR 53G,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Some of the most important questions of human existence have emerged out of moments of spiritual crisis: What purpose does suffering have?

Against Tech?,FYSEMR 58D,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Do machines make life easier or more difficult? Do new technologies create jobs or destroy them? Do we lose a part of our humanity when we interact with machines, or do machines help us to understand what it means to be human? What relation—if any—do technological improvements have with economic, political, and moral improvements? These questions occupy many of us living in contemporary America. They are also questions with long histories. We are not alone. In this first-year seminar, we will ex"

We’ll begin with a high-level introduction to quantum mechanics before digging into lab-based evidence and theoretical models that propos"
"Cartoons, Folklore, and Mythology",FYSEMR 61F,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"The creators of cinematic (and later TV) animation have perennially turned to traditional oral and literary tales about fantastic heroes, villains, tricksters, and settings for their story material.  In the world of the animated “short” and feature-length film, myths, epics, legends, and folktales could come to life in a highly stylized, kinetic, and visually arresting way.  Cartooning created a pathway for traditional stories to live on in the consciousness of twentieth-ce"

Caravaggio and the Beginning of Modern Art,FYSEMR 64R,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, known simply as Caravaggio, in a career of less than two decades at the turn of the 17th century, revolutionized the art of painting: 1) through his dynamic naturalism — the extraordinary plasticity of his figures, the psychological authenticity of their expression; 2) through his extreme exploitation of the deception inherent in naturalism; 3) through his chiaroscuro, a radical new use of light and dark in both harmony and tense conflict with one another; and"
What is it Like to Not Be Human? Metamorphosis in Myth & Poetry,FYSEMR 64S,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"If trees could speak, what would they say? How does that annoying fly buzzing around perceive the room you both inhabit – perceive you? And what kind of traumatic shock could transform you into a mute tree? Or lead you to wake up and discover you have become an insect?In this seminar, we will explore how living things undergo metamorphosis in mythic narratives, poetry, and visual art. How does the Western mythic tradition from Ovid to Kafka imagine such jarring, even violent, self-transformation"
Stories of Gender and Justice,FYSEMR 64U,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"With gender inequities and biases pervasive within and across cultures worldwide, and the global pandemics of gender-based violence and structural violence further intensified by the Covid-19 pandemic, how have individuals, groups, communities, and nations globally fought for (and against) gender justice?

Deciding What (and Who) to Believe,FYSEMR 65G,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"It’s hard to know what to believe these days. Information – or perhaps misinformation – bombards us at all times, but assessing the reliability and trustworthiness of our sources is notoriously difficult. Sometimes it seems as though different groups of people inhabit different worlds, with precious little common ground on precisely the matters that they each take to be most important. These phenomena have not escaped the notice of contemporary epistemologists; that is, philoso"
Who Do You Think You Are?: The Ethics of Identity,FYSEMR 65J,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Personal identity is, to say the least, a slippery concept. Yet insofar it constitutes who and what we are—whether it is explicitly acknowledged or not—identity has deep ethical and political implications, and “identity politics” is one of the most significant contemporary dimensions in political and social thought. This class, which is structured around Anthony Appiah’s 2005 book The Ethics of Identity, delves into the ethical, social, and political questions aroun"
Catholic Thought for Contemporary Challenges,FYSEMR 65S,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Does God exist? If yes, what or who is God? Where does the Universe come from? Are we alone in the Universe?

The Philosophy of Laughter,FYSEMR 66K,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Stop me if you’ve heard this one before.  In this seminar we will pursue one of the most puzzling features of human life:  our capacity for laughter. What do we find humorous and why?  Drawing upon multiple disciplines, from philosophy to neurology, and from psychoanalysis to sociology, we will explore multiple explanations for why we laugh and whether humor is distinctive to human beings. We will explore Rembrandt’s laughter and Haydn’s wit, the sacred “folly” as discussed by the"
"Seeing and Being Scene: Photography, Power, and Liberation in Africa",FYSEMR 66L,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Our world is saturated with photographs. We are photographers, photographed people, and participants in the “event of photography.” But what are photographs exactly? What does it mean to look at a photograph? How does the camera articulate, reflect, and (re)produce social relations and relations of power? In this seminar, we will consider the history of photography in Africa as a practice with both liberatory and oppressive potential. By the end of the semester, students will gain a deeper under"
Humans at Play,FYSEMR 66N,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"We will play with the word ""play.""

"Ukraine: Culture, Power, War",FYSEMR 66O,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Ukraine has captured the world’s attention in recent years – but how much do you know about this country beyond the headlines of war?

"Jews in the Modern Middle East and North Africa, 1800-present",FYSEMR 66P,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Not so long ago, nearly every corner of the Middle East and North Africa was home to thriving Jewish communities who spoke dialects of Arabic, Persian, and Spanish, among other languages; who professed their loyalty to Ottoman sultans, the beys of Tunis, or the sultans of Morocco; and who thought, dreamed, loved, and died according to the rhythms of Muslim-majority societies. Starting in the mid-twentieth century, Jews began leaving the Middle East and North Africa in increasingly large numbers—"
The Search for Life in the Universe,FYSEMR 66Q,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"For millennia, humans (perhaps including yourself) have looked up at the stars and wondered if any of them have planets like Earth, and if so, whether those planets might host life. Now, we know that planets are common outside the solar system, and for the first time in human history, we have the technological capability to search for life beyond Earth. But where should we look first? What kind of measurements should we make? And if we do find life, would we even recognize it? In this semin"
"Morality, Leadership, and Gray-Area Decisions",FYSEMR 70K,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Everyone with serious responsibilities, at work and throughout their lives, faces gray area decisions.

They have to make final decisions on these problems, despite the gray, and these decisions test their competence and their humanity. This seminar offers a variety of important perspectives on gray-area problems and on ways to resolve them, responsibly and effectively."
"Regulating Online Conduct: Speech, Privacy, and the Use and Sharing of Content",FYSEMR 70Z,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"In the course of a few short decades, the Internet has become integral to significant swaths of human experience. It has radically altered modes of interpersonal engagement, democratized access to tools of mass communication, and changed the role of gatekeepers that traditionally controlled access to music, video, and other media. Given the breadth of its impact, it is not surprising that the Internet has pushed the bounds of legal doctrines that govern speech, privacy, and the creation and expl"
Americans at Work in the Age of Robots and Artificial Intelligence,FYSEMR 71G,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Where will the coming generation of Americans (say, today’s 18-year-olds) find jobs?  And will the jobs be worth having?  People have worried about losing their jobs to technology at least since the Luddites 200 years ago.  In the aggregate, they have been wrong.  The automobile put lots of stable boys and saddle makers out of work, but it created vastly more jobs making cars, and fueling them and repairing them, and it opened the way for whole new industries like roads"
"Global Capitalism: Past, Present, Future",FYSEMR 71M,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Few forces have shaped the world over the past millennium more than capitalism has, yet few terms remain more elusive and more divisive. Today, less than half of young Americans view capitalism positively, and calls for alternatives are becoming ever more frequent. Why?

This course takes students on a journey to explore the past, present, a"
"Fat Talk and Thin Ideals: Culture, Social Norms and Weight",FYSEMR 71X,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"In 1995, the Fiji Islands were one of the last places on the planet to receive broadcast television. Within just three years, body weight ideals had transformed from large to thin and purging had become as common in Fijian high school girls as in their Massachusetts counterparts. How can we understand what happened in Fiji? And, likewise, how did heaviness in the U.S. migrate from signifying prestige to stigmatizing? In this seminar, we will examine the bio-social dimensions of disordered eating"
Rituals and Living the Good Life,FYSEMR 71Y,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Why do we knock on wood for good luck? Why do we put birthday candles on cakes? Why do some cultures use black at funerals while others use only white? Why do teams perform team cheers before games? This class will explore the psychology of rituals – those odd, seemingly meaningless behaviors that research shows influence our psychology in profound ways, making the mundane meaningful: dull morning routines can instead get us “ready for our day” and rote work meetings can instea"
A Whale Ship Was My Yale College and My Harvard,FYSEMR 72C,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"How should we live in the world, both with each other and with everything in the natural world around us? It’s a big question and Herman Melville wrote a big book about it, Moby-Dick (1851), from which this seminar takes its title and its focus. The novel tells a tale of humans who go to sea in a wooden ship, sailing to the literal ends of the earth in the deadly pursuit of whales, source of wealth but also vital beings in their own right. It’s a story with serious consequences, especially"

#Adulting: Social Science Perspectives on the Transition to Adulthood,FYSEMR 72U,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Debates about when adolescence ends and adulthood begins often lead to judgements about how long youth today are taking to reach adulthood and uncertainties about what it means to become an adult. The transition from adolescence to adulthood is often fraught with anxieties about realizing one’s dreams, getting into college, succeeding in the job market, and finding a life partner. Have the definitions and markers of adulthood changed across generations?  Should these conceptualization"
Holding Politicians Accountable,FYSEMR 72X,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Across the world, massive street protests and growing disdain for politics not only suggest high citizen dissatisfaction with politicians’ performance—from poor public services, high corruption, and increasing crime—but highlight the difficulty of holding politicians accountable to the voters who put them in office. Democracies are designed with certain mechanisms to generate political accountability.  Re-elections are meant to give voters a tool to reward or punish incumb"
Socialism,FYSEMR 73F,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Does socialism have a future?After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the embrace of the market by China, and the definitive turn of the Western European Left towards accommodation with the existing capitalist order, socialism was consigned to the dustbin of history.

"Unequal Origins: Pregnancy, Poverty and Child Health",FYSEMR 73L,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"The US has worse pregnancy and child outcomes than any other high-income country in the world.

How Wars End: The Role of Negotiation,FYSEMR 73Q,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"This seminar will explore the role of negotiation in terminating wars.  It is commonly thought that wars end after a decisive military battle produces a conclusive victory – one side surrenders and the other side emerges victorious. In fact, recent history suggests things are typically much more complicated: negotiations between the disputants commonly play a critical role in ending armed conflict. One only must consider Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq.This seminar will"

"Antisemitism, Then and Now",FYSEMR 73V,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Why do people hate each other?  Why are some groups of people more likely to be hated than others? This seminar seeks to answer these questions through the study of the hatred of Jews, commonly known as antisemitism.

Skepticism and Knowledge,FYSEMR 31J,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Descartes wrote his Meditations because he realized that, although he had received the best education in the world, much of what he had learned was false or unfounded.

This seminar will give students an opportunity to demystify the art of acting by introducing them to the basic tools of the trade—they will learn about the craft of acting by actually “doing” it. It will provide an introduction to acting by combinin"
"Human Rights, Law and Advocacy",FYSEMR 41K,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Human rights practitioners confront numerous ethical, strategic, and legal dilemmas in their struggles for social justice.

The seminar is designed to encourage students to critically evaluate the human rights movement while offering an introduction to some of the essential t"
When Bad things Happen Early in Life: Effects of Early Adversity on Brain & Behavioral Development,FYSEMR 43F,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Decades of research tell us that the foundations of healthy development are built early in life. Genes provide the basic blueprint for brain architecture, but experiences shape the activity of the genome and thus determine how the circuitry is wired. Significant adversity can derail developmental processes and distort brain maturation, leading to limited economic and social mobility. Exposure to significant adversity early in life, particularly during critical periods of brain development, may i"
The Economist's View of the World,FYSEMR 43J,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"This seminar's goal is to probe how economists of various perspectives view human behavior and the proper role of government in society. Over the semester, seminar participants will read several brief, nontechnical, policy-oriented books by prominent economists. The participants will discuss each work's strengths and weaknesses, exploring the positive scientific judgments and normative value systems that underlie the author’s policy prescriptions.  To prepare for each book dis"
"History, Nationalism, and the World: The Case of Korea",FYSEMR 43W,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"This seminar will explore the quandary that faces all historians:  To what extent is the understanding of past episodes influenced by current politics and to what extent is current politics influenced by people’s understanding of the past?  In the study of Korean history, this question is particularly sharp since the postcolonial division of Korea into North and South has thrust the memory of past events into current political discussions as well as scholarly debates.  The s"
Declarations of Independence: The Political Philosophy of the American Revolution,FYSEMR 47U,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"As the 250th anniversary of the US Declaration of Independence approaches in 2026, this seminar will examine that familiar document in some unfamiliar contexts.  At the same time, it will provide a focused introduction to the development of modern ideas of rights, nationality, and statehood and will encourage students to place the United States in historical perspective and within an international context.  The Declaration drew upon two centuries of arguments justifying rebellion, sece"
Measurements of the Mind: The Creation and Critique of the Psychological Test,FYSEMR 49N,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"For well over a century, psychologists have worked with schools, corporations, immigration officers, the military, and psychiatrists to sort the American population into groups in order to make a number of key judgments.  Special tests – designed to measure everything from intelligence to vocational aptitudes to personality – have been at the center of that effort.  In this course, we will explore the at times controversial story of psychological testing, and its larger imp"
Science in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,FYSEMR 51C,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Science is focused on discovering and explaining the world around and within us. This has been its goal for hundreds of years and has produced astonishing breakthroughs from population genetics, to general relativity, to plate tectonics. Artificial intelligence is touted as a tool for learning about a complex system in ways that humans can’t and has seen exceptional progress in natural language processing and image identification. In this class we explore the emerging linkages between scie"
The Story of the Alternating Sign Matrix Conjecture,FYSEMR 51E,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"This seminar is intended to illustrate how research in mathematics actually progresses, using recent examples from the field of algebraic combinatorics. We will learn about the story of the search for and discovery of a proof of a formula conjectured by Mills-Robbins- Rumsey in the early 1980's: the number of n x n alternating sign matrices. Alternating sign matrices are a curious family of mathematical objects, generalizing permutation matrices, which arise from an algorithm for evaluating"
Understanding the Seemingly Impossible: A Revolution in Biology,FYSEMR 51F,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Occasionally a scientific discovery is so unexpected that it is seemingly unexplainable. This seminar will revisit one such event, the discovery of RNA interference and how modern experimental molecular genetics cracked this ""problem"" and started a billion-dollar industry. Rare unexpected discoveries in biology, for example catalytic RNAs, instantly extend and broaden our understanding of the world, while the impact of other discoveries (split genes, hopping genes) are more g"
"Skin, Our Largest, Hottest, and Coolest Organ: From Cancer to Cosmetics",FYSEMR 51M,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Skin provides a protective barrier that is vital to survival of all multicellular organisms. Its physical properties have been exploited for centuries, from clothing to footballs, and yet skin is a vibrant and dynamic organ that responds to environmental signals in myriad ways. Skin protects humans from toxic exposures, but can also be an intrinsic source of dangerous diseases. While its defects only rarely kill humans, its imperfections can cause misery and discomfort, ranging from subtle annoy"
Natural History Museums and the Anthropocene,FYSEMR 51S,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Natural history museums have inspired us for centuries and represent our best resources for understanding nature. They have been central to the development of countless scientific principles, including the theory of evolution itself. Yet the more inward facing missions of a museum are unfamiliar and the collections that sustain these efforts are vast and remain largely invisible. These institutions, however, have assumed a renewed relevance in the modern era of global change, especially as milli"
Tree,FYSEMR 52C,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Have you hugged a tree lately?  How about grown one? Photographed one? Drawn one? Written about one?  Imagine a semester devoted to connecting two organisms: a person (you) and a tree (not you).  Interacting with a single tree, you will explore its individual history, evolutionary history, life cycle, leaves, bark, roots, flowers, cones, and architecture.In an age of environmental destruction and outright murder of our biological brethren, there is something deeply troubling about"
Life and Death Lessons from the Fossil Record,FYSEMR 52L,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"The fossil record offers a unique perspective on the history of Life on Earth. Although palaeontology might remind us of grotesque bones, dusty museum cabinets, and quirky scientists who relish both of those things—or God forbid, Ross Geller from Friends­—the knowledge derived from the fossil record affects our daily lives in ways that are not immediately apparent. From its natural history origins during the 19th century, paleontology has become a cornerstone of neo-Darwinian evo"
"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): Myths, Media and Meaning",FYSEMR 52Z,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"This first-year seminar will dive into the science and fiction of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) through engagement with multiple sources, including research articles and reports, social media, news media, psychology guidelines, and clinical cases.

"Big Data, Tall Tales",FYSEMR 53F,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Students in this seminar will get their hands dirty playing with data as we explore how to be judicious consumers of it. The huge swaths of data now available allow us to tell stories, big and small, some true and some not so true. With an emphasis on news media representations, we will take a deep dive into thinking about how data are generated, what we can (and cannot) discern from data, and how we can wrangle it to create narratives. Students will learn how to visualize and summarize data usi"
Literature of Spiritual Crisis,FYSEMR 53G,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Some of the most important questions of human existence have emerged out of moments of spiritual crisis: What purpose does suffering have? How does one find meaning in life?  What if God or the divine is silent, absent, or uncaring?Literature and the arts have proven to be especially fruitful areas for people not only to explore these religious and philosophical questions but also to offer ways of finding consolation in the midst of crisis.  In this seminar we will study a wide range o"
Genuinely Hard Problems in Science,FYSEMR 58C,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"This seminar explores some of science's most significant unsolved challenges: Genuinely Hard Problems (GHPs) that have stumped researchers despite their best efforts. To solve these problems, technical execution is not enough—we need true conceptual breakthroughs. Examples include reconciling quantum mechanics with gravity or finding the biological mechanisms that cause mental illness.A key part of the seminar is identifying a GHP that deeply interests you. Each week will feature Harvard faculty"
Against Tech?,FYSEMR 58D,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Do machines make life easier or more difficult? Do new technologies create jobs or destroy them? Do we lose a part of our humanity when we interact with machines, or do machines help us to understand what it means to be human? What relation—if any—do technological improvements have with economic, political, and moral improvements? These questions occupy many of us living in contemporary America. They are also questions with long histories. We are not alone. In this first-year seminar, we will ex"
Machine Ecology: Autonomous Robots for Environmental Restoration,FYSEMR 58E,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Have you ever wondered how technology and innovation can tackle some of the world's most pressing environmental challenges?

The Quantum Edge of Life,FYSEMR 58G,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"How much of life’s complexity is forged by quantum phenomena that usually live in the rarefied world of physics labs? In this First-Year Seminar, we’ll explore how coherence, superposition, entanglement, and other quantum effects might manifest in biological processes— from photosynthesis to avian navigation and perhaps even in the workings of the human brain. We’ll begin with a high-level introduction to quantum mechanics before digging into lab-based evidence and theoretical models that propos"
"Cartoons, Folklore, and Mythology",FYSEMR 61F,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"The creators of cinematic (and later TV) animation have perennially turned to traditional oral and literary tales about fantastic heroes, villains, tricksters, and settings for their story material.  In the world of the animated “short” and feature-length film, myths, epics, legends, and folktales could come to life in a highly stylized, kinetic, and visually arresting way.  Cartooning created a pathway for traditional stories to live on in the consciousness of twentieth-ce"
"Harvard’s Greatest Hits: The Most Important, Rarest, and Most Valuable Books in Houghton Library",FYSEMR 62J,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Have you ever fantasized of turning the pages of a Gutenberg Bible with your own fingers?   Or a medieval illustrated Book of Hours?  Or touching a papyrus fragment of Homer?  Or a First Folio edition of Shakespeare?  Or seeing close-up Copernicus’ diagram of the heliocentric universe?   The Houghton Library of Harvard University is one of the world’s greatest repositories of ancient scrolls, papyrus codices, illuminated manuscripts on parchment and paper, early pr"
Vegetal Humanities: Paying Attention to Plants in Contemporary Art and Culture,FYSEMR 63W,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"This class invites you to practice a new kind of plant-consciousness. Our guides will be contemporary artists and thinkers who are encouraging new relationships between human and vegetal life, or recalling very old ones. Suddenly, we have plant protagonists, gardens in galleries, and botany-based forms of philosophy, architecture, music and more. Following the lead of these culture-makers and their work, we will draw on the new science of plant communication and learning in this class; unco"
Looking for Clues. Ancient and Medieval Art @ Harvard,FYSEMR 64I,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Objects are essential primary sources for the study of the past. They are imbued with tales of their makers, of societies in which they took shape, of customs and beliefs that lent them meaning, and of routes that facilitated their dissemination. In this interdisciplinary and highly interactive First-Year Seminar, participants will hone the art of looking through the close-up study and discussion of ancient and medieval ceramics, textiles, and metalwork from the world-class collections of the Ha"
Caravaggio and the Beginning of Modern Art,FYSEMR 64R,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, known simply as Caravaggio, in a career of less than two decades at the turn of the 17th century, revolutionized the art of painting: 1) through his dynamic naturalism — the extraordinary plasticity of his figures, the psychological authenticity of their expression; 2) through his extreme exploitation of the deception inherent in naturalism; 3) through his chiaroscuro, a radical new use of light and dark in both harmony and tense conflict with one another; and"
What is it Like to Not Be Human? Metamorphosis in Myth & Poetry,FYSEMR 64S,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"If trees could speak, what would they say? How does that annoying fly buzzing around perceive the room you both inhabit – perceive you? And what kind of traumatic shock could transform you into a mute tree? Or lead you to wake up and discover you have become an insect?In this seminar, we will explore how living things undergo metamorphosis in mythic narratives, poetry, and visual art. How does the Western mythic tradition from Ovid to Kafka imagine such jarring, even violent, self-transformation"
Stories of Gender and Justice,FYSEMR 64U,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"With gender inequities and biases pervasive within and across cultures worldwide, and the global pandemics of gender-based violence and structural violence further intensified by the Covid-19 pandemic, how have individuals, groups, communities, and nations globally fought for (and against) gender justice? How have struggles against gender injustice intersected and conflicted with struggles against racial, ethnic, environmental, health, LGBTQIA+ and other forms of injustice?    Gen"
Deciding What (and Who) to Believe,FYSEMR 65G,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"It’s hard to know what to believe these days. Information – or perhaps misinformation – bombards us at all times, but assessing the reliability and trustworthiness of our sources is notoriously difficult. Sometimes it seems as though different groups of people inhabit different worlds, with precious little common ground on precisely the matters that they each take to be most important. These phenomena have not escaped the notice of contemporary epistemologists; that is, philoso"
Who Do You Think You Are?: The Ethics of Identity,FYSEMR 65J,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Personal identity is, to say the least, a slippery concept. Yet insofar it constitutes who and what we are—whether it is explicitly acknowledged or not—identity has deep ethical and political implications, and “identity politics” is one of the most significant contemporary dimensions in political and social thought. This class, which is structured around Anthony Appiah’s 2005 book The Ethics of Identity, delves into the ethical, social, and political questions aroun"
Catholic Thought for Contemporary Challenges,FYSEMR 65S,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Does God exist? If yes, what or who is God? Where does the Universe come from? Are we alone in the Universe? What is a good life? Are there universal human rights? Can wars be just? What makes a good leader? This seminar will use texts and art from the Catholic intellectual tradition to explore how Catholic thought can be applied to contemporary challenges, as well as areas where there may be tension between such thought and contemporary ideas. While the seminar addresses the thought from one pa"
"Detention, Deportation, and Due Process: A Look at the Inner Workings of the U.S. Immigration System",FYSEMR 66D,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"The public discourse on immigration is widespread and divisive. If you have ever wanted to know more about how our immigration system operates, its faults, and potential ways to fix it, then this seminar is for you. The goal of the seminar is to teach students in an interactive and welcoming environment the basic aspects of U.S. immigration policy, the role of lawyers in immigration advocacy spaces, and how to develop creative advocacy strategies to advance immigrants’ rights. The course will le"
Fanfiction,FYSEMR 66H,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Fanfiction is one of the most popular forms of literature today, with fourteen million stories hosted on just the Archive of Our Own (one of the major digital fanfiction archives).

We will dive into fanfiction’s past and present, learning about the history of copyright, early print zine fandom, and fanfiction in the digital age"
Is Being Good Actually Good for the Body?,FYSEMR 66I,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Did you know that kindness is good for your health? Did you know that happiness is contagious? Did you know that music lowers your cortisol levels? The science is in! This seminar will examine how the biology of prosocial behaviors shows how kindness and optimism improve overall well-being in profound and demonstrable ways. We will delve into a revolutionary approach to health, longevity, and quality of life and explain the scientific evidence that supports this work. The class will investigate"
The Philosophy of Laughter,FYSEMR 66K,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Stop me if you’ve heard this one before.  In this seminar we will pursue one of the most puzzling features of human life:  our capacity for laughter. What do we find humorous and why?  Drawing upon multiple disciplines, from philosophy to neurology, and from psychoanalysis to sociology, we will explore multiple explanations for why we laugh and whether humor is distinctive to human beings. We will explore Rembrandt’s laughter and Haydn’s wit, the sacred “folly” as discussed by the"
"Seeing and Being Scene: Photography, Power, and Liberation in Africa",FYSEMR 66L,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Our world is saturated with photographs. We are photographers, photographed people, and participants in the “event of photography.” But what are photographs exactly? What does it mean to look at a photograph? How does the camera articulate, reflect, and (re)produce social relations and relations of power? In this seminar, we will consider the history of photography in Africa as a practice with both liberatory and oppressive potential. By the end of the semester, students will gain a deeper under"
Humans at Play,FYSEMR 66N,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"We will play with the word ""play."" What do we play (an instrument? a game?), who do we play (an enemy? a friend?), where do we play (at home, on stage, in the park?) What makes us winners and losers? This course will explore various approaches to games and humans at play. We will try to understand why and how people play; why we have fun while playing; why we prefer some games to others. Interdisciplinary in nature, the course will offer readings from areas of transactional analysis, psychology,"
"Ukraine: Culture, Power, War",FYSEMR 66O,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Ukraine has captured the world’s attention in recent years – but how much do you know about this country beyond the headlines of war? From Crimea to Chernobyl, from Gogol to Soviet dissidents, from Kyivan Rus to the Russo-Ukrainian war, this course explores the cultural history of Ukraine and the power of culture in resisting domination. Along the way, we will read banned poetry, explore rare archives, talk with scholars and artists, and watch films that bring Ukraine’s past and present vividly"
"Jews in the Modern Middle East and North Africa, 1800-present",FYSEMR 66P,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Not so long ago, nearly every corner of the Middle East and North Africa was home to thriving Jewish communities who spoke dialects of Arabic, Persian, and Spanish, among other languages; who professed their loyalty to Ottoman sultans, the beys of Tunis, or the sultans of Morocco; and who thought, dreamed, loved, and died according to the rhythms of Muslim-majority societies. Starting in the mid-twentieth century, Jews began leaving the Middle East and North Africa in increasingly large numbers—"
The Search for Life in the Universe,FYSEMR 66Q,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"For millennia, humans (perhaps including yourself) have looked up at the stars and wondered if any of them have planets like Earth, and if so, whether those planets might host life. Now, we know that planets are common outside the solar system, and for the first time in human history, we have the technological capability to search for life beyond Earth. But where should we look first? What kind of measurements should we make? And if we do find life, would we even recognize it? In this semin"
"Morality, Leadership, and Gray-Area Decisions",FYSEMR 70K,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Everyone with serious responsibilities, at work and throughout their lives, faces gray area decisions. In organizations, these highly uncertain, high-stakes decisions are delegated upward, to men and women in leadership positions. They have to make final decisions on these problems, despite the gray, and these decisions test their competence and their humanity. This seminar offers a variety of important perspectives on gray-area problems and on ways to resolve them, responsibly and effectively."
"Regulating Online Conduct: Speech, Privacy, and the Use and Sharing of Content",FYSEMR 70Z,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"In the course of a few short decades, the Internet has become integral to significant swaths of human experience. It has radically altered modes of interpersonal engagement, democratized access to tools of mass communication, and changed the role of gatekeepers that traditionally controlled access to music, video, and other media. Given the breadth of its impact, it is not surprising that the Internet has pushed the bounds of legal doctrines that govern speech, privacy, and the creation and expl"
Americans at Work in the Age of Robots and Artificial Intelligence,FYSEMR 71G,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Where will the coming generation of Americans (say, today’s 18-year-olds) find jobs?  And will the jobs be worth having?  People have worried about losing their jobs to technology at least since the Luddites 200 years ago.  In the aggregate, they have been wrong.  The automobile put lots of stable boys and saddle makers out of work, but it created vastly more jobs making cars, and fueling them and repairing them, and it opened the way for whole new industries like roads"
"Global Capitalism: Past, Present, Future",FYSEMR 71M,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Few forces have shaped the world over the past millennium more than capitalism has, yet few terms remain more elusive and more divisive. Today, less than half of young Americans view capitalism positively, and calls for alternatives are becoming ever more frequent. Why? And why have different forms of capitalism led to such unequal outcomes around the world? What is capitalism, really; what has it been, and what might it be? This course takes students on a journey to explore the past, present, a"
"Fat Talk and Thin Ideals: Culture, Social Norms and Weight",FYSEMR 71X,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"In 1995, the Fiji Islands were one of the last places on the planet to receive broadcast television. Within just three years, body weight ideals had transformed from large to thin and purging had become as common in Fijian high school girls as in their Massachusetts counterparts. How can we understand what happened in Fiji? And, likewise, how did heaviness in the U.S. migrate from signifying prestige to stigmatizing? In this seminar, we will examine the bio-social dimensions of disordered eating"
Rituals and Living the Good Life,FYSEMR 71Y,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Why do we knock on wood for good luck? Why do we put birthday candles on cakes? Why do some cultures use black at funerals while others use only white? Why do teams perform team cheers before games? This class will explore the psychology of rituals – those odd, seemingly meaningless behaviors that research shows influence our psychology in profound ways, making the mundane meaningful: dull morning routines can instead get us “ready for our day” and rote work meetings can instea"
A Whale Ship Was My Yale College and My Harvard,FYSEMR 72C,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"How should we live in the world, both with each other and with everything in the natural world around us? It’s a big question and Herman Melville wrote a big book about it, Moby-Dick (1851), from which this seminar takes its title and its focus. The novel tells a tale of humans who go to sea in a wooden ship, sailing to the literal ends of the earth in the deadly pursuit of whales, source of wealth but also vital beings in their own right. It’s a story with serious consequences, especially"
"Everyday I’m Hustlin’: Pop Culture, Youth, and the African City",FYSEMR 72I,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Cities today face broad challenges ranging from public health emergencies (e.g. Covid-19), to anti-police brutality protests (e.g. #ICan’tBreathe), and unemployment. Stuck in a frustrating period of “waithood” or waiting for adulthood, urban youths in Africa are increasingly devising enterprising ways to improvise their livelihoods and assert their right to the city. One creative way in which youths are responding to everyday uncertainty and frustrations is through the power of"
Corporate Power & Human Rights—Community Resistance and Social Movements,FYSEMR 72P,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"How do the seemingly most marginalized take on the most powerful corporations in the world and win? In this seminar, we will delve into this question and what drives community resistance and social movements in the face of frequently daunting odds. We will zero in on community resistance in its many forms when confronting abusive corporations and authoritarian governments often supporting them. Through case studies involving natural gas in Myanmar, gold mining in Papua New Guinea, and chocolate"
#Adulting: Social Science Perspectives on the Transition to Adulthood,FYSEMR 72U,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Debates about when adolescence ends and adulthood begins often lead to judgements about how long youth today are taking to reach adulthood and uncertainties about what it means to become an adult. The transition from adolescence to adulthood is often fraught with anxieties about realizing one’s dreams, getting into college, succeeding in the job market, and finding a life partner. Have the definitions and markers of adulthood changed across generations?  Should these conceptualization"
Holding Politicians Accountable,FYSEMR 72X,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Across the world, massive street protests and growing disdain for politics not only suggest high citizen dissatisfaction with politicians’ performance—from poor public services, high corruption, and increasing crime—but highlight the difficulty of holding politicians accountable to the voters who put them in office. Democracies are designed with certain mechanisms to generate political accountability.  Re-elections are meant to give voters a tool to reward or punish incumb"
Socialism,FYSEMR 73F,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Does socialism have a future?After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the embrace of the market by China, and the definitive turn of the Western European Left towards accommodation with the existing capitalist order, socialism was consigned to the dustbin of history. Only to rise from the dead: according to a 2022 Pew Research poll, more young Americans have a favorable view of socialism (44 percent) than of capitalism (40 percent). This seminar will address the future of socialism by interr"
"Unequal Origins: Pregnancy, Poverty and Child Health",FYSEMR 73L,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"The US has worse pregnancy and child outcomes than any other high-income country in the world. Is this because we spend less providing direct income support to families than other high-income countries? This course will discuss the intersection between maternal and child health outcomes and poverty in the United States through a medical, economic, political, and historical lens. Assignments will ask students to become familiar with and attempt to navigate available supports for pregnant people a"
How Wars End: The Role of Negotiation,FYSEMR 73Q,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"This seminar will explore the role of negotiation in terminating wars.  It is commonly thought that wars end after a decisive military battle produces a conclusive victory – one side surrenders and the other side emerges victorious. In fact, recent history suggests things are typically much more complicated: negotiations between the disputants commonly play a critical role in ending armed conflict. One only must consider Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq.This seminar will"
Crime and Justice in a Changing America,FYSEMR 73S,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"This seminar examines key changes in crime and the criminal justice system over the last half-century, including the dramatic rise in violence starting in the 1960s, mass incarceration starting in the mid-1970s, the unexpected crime decline in the 1990s, the policing crisis heightened by George Floyd’s murder in 2020, and historic rises in gun violence during the pandemic era. We will explore these important changes in light of competing explanations of crime and punishment. Inequalities b"
"Antisemitism, Then and Now",FYSEMR 73V,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Why do people hate each other?  Why are some groups of people more likely to be hated than others? This seminar seeks to answer these questions through the study of the hatred of Jews, commonly known as antisemitism.  Jews have lived throughout the world over thousands of years, and they have been hated for diverse and at times contradictory reasons – they are said to be too different or trying too hard to fit it; religious extremists or extremist secularists; rich capitalists or revol"
Shared Prosperity in a Fractured Global Economy,FYSEMR 73W,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Can we build a global economic order that promotes equity, poverty reduction, and climate sustainability, all at once? How do we alleviate the tensions between domestic equality and global equality? Can we restore the middle class in advanced countries while maintaining an open global economy? Can we achieve the climate transition without adverse effects on economic growth and poverty reduction in poor nations? We will explore these questions in the seminar and build towards practical policy sol"
Abortion in Controversy,FYSEMR 73Y,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Today the law of abortion in America is more in flux than it has been for decades. Educated citizens should have opportunities to study the issue in detail and to decide what they think. This seminar is designed to help first-year students discuss, in an academic setting, the difficult, important, and controversial questions raised by abortion. These include questions of ethics, policy, and law; of human personhood and futures of value; of autonomy and equality; of politics and history; and of u"

The Power and Beauty of Being In Between: The Story of Armenia,GENED 1185,FAS,General Education,"How can one small, remote country change the way we think about the culture of the world?Being wedged between superpowers might seem like a recipe for ethnic assimilation and cultural conformity. Yet what if it made you stronger? In the case of Armenia, being “in-between” led to a vibrant, diverse, and resilient culture, a distinctive religious and national identity, and a dynamic diaspora. Travelling from antiquity to modernity, we will explore how Armenia and Armenians survive"
"The Age of Anxiety: Histories, Theories, Remedies",GENED 1186,FAS,General Education,"How have authors throughout history channeled anxiety into meaningful and imaginative works of art?The poet WH Auden described the 1940s as “the age of anxiety,” but he could have been describing our own stress-ridden times: anxiety is today the most common class of contemporary mental health condition.

Learning and Unlearning,GENED 1199,FAS,General Education,"How do we learn and why?From birth, we embark on a lifelong journey of learning that shapes nearly everything we know and do, and ultimately who we become. Yet, we often fail to examine the implicit assumptions and approaches underlying our learning. In addition, we often overlook the importance of unlearning – the process of letting go of inaccurate information, misguided beliefs, harmful biases, limiting mindsets, and unproductive habits to make room for new learning. Unlearning has always bee"

In addition to cities situated within Asia, we will examine diasporic urban"
Political Myth,SOC-STD 98PM,FAS,Social Studies,"Political myth, or ideologically-marked narratives that are essential to the identity of a social group, has often been thought of as antithetical to political theory. By obscuring the truth in false narratives, or by communicating truths through narrative and arational means, myth has been interpreted as hostile to freedom, liberalism, rationalism, and deliberative democracy. And yet, despite Max Weber’s claim that the modern world had become ‘disenchanted,’ the last century saw an explosion of"

We will reconstruct the Frankfurt School’s evolving theory through its connections t"
Religion in Politics,SOC-STD 98RI,FAS,Social Studies,"This course problematizes the place, space, and role of religion in political and social life. We will question how, when, and why religion shapes, generates, and complicates politics, and if religion as such ontologically belongs to any political party or location on a right-left spectrum or a public-private distinction. We will explore these dynamics through primary and secondary works of political theory and intellectual history, and focus on ideas, concepts, and traditions such as civil reli"
Slavery and Race in American Law,SOC-STD 98SR,FAS,Social Studies,"This course will explore the relationship between enslavement and racialization in American law. The course will start from the premise that American slavery was an institution that enlisted law in support of power and exploitation. As the institution transformed over time, so did the contours of the law. The course will first examine the early-modern Atlantic world, where we will compare the legal regimes of slavery in the British, French, and Spanish empires.  We will use various kinds of"
Statecraft and Sexuality,SOC-STD 98SS,FAS,Social Studies,"Sexuality is central to modern statecraft. This junior tutorial explores how – and why – states regulate sex, sexual violence, sexual taboos, sexual identities, and even talk of sex. Through attention to cases in North America and Southern Africa, we learn how sexuality is embedded in state formation, in the distribution of citizenship entitlements, and in efforts to maintain political legitimacy. Transnational comparisons elucidate generalizable features of sexuality and statecraft, as well as"
Inequality Under Capitalism,SOC-STD 98WB,FAS,Social Studies,"All capitalist societies are characterized by significant forms of inequality. Some people and some groups have more of the things that we think make for a good life, while other people and other groups have less. But inequality is not static; not all societies are equally unequal. Social and political movements have transformed the distribution of well-being in numerous ways. This class ponders the empirical and normative questions raised by these facts. First, what explains inequality? Why do"
The Politics of Health and Medicine in the United States,SOC-STD 98WD,FAS,Social Studies,"How does politics shape our health? In this multidisciplinary class, students explore the historical origins of institutions like Medicare and Medicaid, the FDA, and the NIH.

Students learn how epidemiologists and clinicians today think about social determinants of health, especially racial disparities in care an"
Climate Justice: The Politics of Decarbonization,SOC-STD 98WH,FAS,Social Studies,"Given the urgent need to shift societies away from carbon-based energy, how can such transitions occur so as not to reproduce existing injustices? Answering this question requires an interdisciplinary approach. Texts from historians and anthropologists will provide insight into how societies across time and space have made large-scale energy transitions. Political science scholarship will contribute knowledge about political transitions, which were widespread in the twentieth century, from socia"
"Infrastructure, Mediation, Sociality",SOC-STD 98WM,FAS,Social Studies,"Infrastructures make their social significance felt in a variety of ways: through the technologies that mediate their use, the materials from which they are made, and their sensory and aesthetic presence in our everyday lives. How does database design impact how we buy and sell things? How is wood sourced and processed for the construction of housing stock? What might a bridge do besides facilitate a crossing? Each of these aspects of infrastructure can exert their influence at multiple scales a"

Tutorial in Sociological Theory,SOCIOL 97,FAS,Sociology,"This course introduces students to the complicated, conflictual, and often contradictory theoretical origins of sociology as a discipline.  We begin by reading the standard sociological “canon”—Marx, Weber, and Durkheim—and interrogating why their ideas were canonized over others.  We then read scholars who have been historically “written out” of the social sciences to evaluate their important, yet historically underappreciated, contributio"
Junior Tutorial: Sociology of Immigration: Latinx,SOCIOL 98GE,FAS,Sociology,"This junior tutorial examines Latinx immigrant incorporation from a sociological perspective that approaches migration as a lifelong process starting from the context of origin (Latin America) and continuing in the context of reception (the US). To this end, we will explore questions that consider elements of the history of Latin America as part of what shapes the trajectories of Latinx in the US. What are the lasting impacts of Spanish colonization in Latin America that shape immigration into t"

Inequality Under Capitalism,SOC-STD 98WB,FAS,Social Studies,"All capitalist societies are characterized by significant forms of inequality.

The History of Energy,HIST 76,FAS,History,"Modern life is defined by our use of energy: fossil fuels, hydroelectricity, nuclear power, renewables. These forms of energy power modern economies, politics, and everyday life.

Humanity’s seemingly boundless appetite for energy has also remade global climate. This course tracks the development of modern energy history from the advent of age of coal to"
Heidegger’s Being and Time,HIST 83,FAS,History,"Martin Heidegger’s famous first book, Being and Time, is one of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century.

Atlantic Slave Wars,HIST 120,FAS,History,"This course explores how the violence of imperial expansion and transatlantic enslavement remade the history of Europe, Africa, and the Americas. European imperial conflicts extended the dominion of capitalist agriculture. African battles fed captives to the transatlantic trade in slaves.

Asian American Women in the Archive: Schlesinger Library Immersive Course,HIST 165,FAS,History,"Asian Americans are the fastest growing group in the US, yet the long and diverse histories of Asian Americans, especially Asian American women, have often been absent from the research and teaching of American history. Much of this invisibility is due to the absence of Asian American women in the archives that historians traditionally use to write history. Asian American women’s experiences of migration, labor, and activism can be particularly hard to find in institutional archives. When"
"Race, Gender, and the Law Through the Archive",HIST 167,FAS,History,"From First Lady Michelle Obama to political mastermind Stacy Abrams to Vice President Kamala Harris, Black women have left their stamp on 21st-century politics and grassroots organizing.

"World War II in Image, Text, and Sound",HIST-LIT 90GT,FAS,History & Literature,"Almost eighty years after the end of World War II, its legacies are alive as ever. The conflict was fought across much of the globe, ravaging landscapes and ecosystems and wiping villages, towns, and even cities from the face of the earth. Estimates of combined civilian and military deaths typically range between 50,000,000 and 85,000,000, an almost unimaginably devastating toll. Yet how does our understanding of World War II change when we return to literature, art, music, and other cultural wo"
U.S. Women of Color Feminisms since the 1970s,HIST-LIT 90GX,FAS,History & Literature,"The history of U.S. women of color feminist politics and expressive cultures is one filled with Black, Indigenous, Chicana, and Asian American thinkers who have demanded that we take seriously how categories such as race, sex, gender, sexuality, class, and ability shape our world and our relation to it.

The American West,HIST-LIT 90HA,FAS,History & Literature,"From cowboys to “tech bros,” images of the American West are everywhere—and they have been for a long time.

Oral Histories and Archives,HIST-LIT 93AG,FAS,History & Literature,"To understand the archive is to understand history: neither is neutral, homogenous, nor fully representative of any one story. Indeed, many scholars argue that archives aren’t repositories for objective truths but rather political and epistemological projects that have the power to suppress certain voices—or liberate them. How can we make sense of the archive in a way that counters historical silences? And how might oral histories fill in gaps left by archival negations? This course introduces s"

Oral Histories and Archives,HIST-LIT 93AG,FAS,History & Literature,"To understand the archive is to understand history: neither is neutral, homogenous, nor fully representative of any one story.

Nāgeśa on God's Linguistic Conventionalism,SANSKRIT 220,FAS,South Asian Studies,"Often considered to be the last among influential new Pāṇinīya thinkers, Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa does not only build on Bharṭrhari’s non-dualism, but also accommodates the concept of an Īśvara within his own semantic theory. Unlike Kauṇḍa Bhaṭṭa, he also seeks to refute the old and new Naiyāyikas’ position that Īśvara’s desire is the basis for direct expression (śakti), which itself constitutes linguistic convention (saṅketa). By separating the two concepts, Nāgeśa carves out a unique space for Īśvara wit"
