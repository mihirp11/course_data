"Asian & Asian American Studies","AAS 332","Japanese Literature in the Meiji Era","This course examines Japanese literature of the Meiji era, an era unique in the history of the world. Until the 1400s, Japan had no contact with the West due to its geographic location. After a brief and limited exposure to Western literature, Japan closed its doors to the West and remained isolated from approximately 1600 until 1868. During the Meiji Era (1868-1912) Japan was flooded with examples of all the phases of Western literature it had missed, and Japanese writers soon responded to the Western developments. This course will deal with that response, from Tsubouchi Shyoyo’s criticism of modern Japanese novels and their lack of appreciation for Realism, to the development of the Japanese I-novel. Due to Japan’s literary response to the West, it can also be argued that the Meiji Era marked the end of Japanese literature as a unique entity, and this course will explore this issue as well.","3 credits"

"History","HIS 309","Victorian Britain and Monsters: A Peculiar History of Empire","Focuses on the impact of empire and urbanization on Victorian society, culture and politics, and especially upon Victorian conceptions of gender, race, and racial difference as the basis of national greatness, superiority and global social hierarchy. At war with indigenous peoples in its empire for almost the entire century, and faced with restive and even revolutionary laborers, Irish Home Rulers and suffragettes on the domestic front, Victorians formulated imaginary solutions to the real social and political problems faced at home and in the colonies, and these formulations of monsters, social or supernatural impacted nothing less than western conceptions of modernity itself. National and imperial developments across hemispheric and transoceanic space provide the larger contexts for the two assigned novels (about monsters) and historical narratives and primary sources (about Victorian society). Finally, the course also teaches historians how to use literary fiction as historical sources (a methodology distinct from but linked to that of literature departments), in conjunction with primary and secondary historical works.

"History","HIS 310","Britain Since 1945: Postcolonial Disruptions","Examines the ‘great events’ of the post World War period and the patterns of social, economic, and political change through the lens of British experience. In particular, we will attend to the impact of decolonization on issues of race, class and gender within British domestic culture. Britain entered the 20th century as the world’s premier imperial power, the barometer of global technological, cultural, political and intellectual developments. As the empire disintegrated, wracked by world wars and nationalist revolts, the British state took up a different kind of revolution – a ‘socialist’ revolution–that sought to give its citizens economic and social security ‘from the cradle to the grave.’ At the same time, British society was significantly enlivened, and further transformed, by the influx of immigrants from former colonies and the Commonwealth. The second half of the twentieth century thus marked the successes and failures of the twinned projects of socialism and decolonization, while also producing new kinds of mass cultural exports that continue to shape global culture. These narratives of changing configurations of empire, class, race, gender and politics are the subject of our course, and will be explored through imaginative and historical literature and film.

"Human Evolutionary Biology","EBH 405","Life History and Development","Uses life history theory as a framework for exploring the biological processes of the primate and human life cycle (development, reproduction, senescence). We will first construct a solid foundation of life history theory and the principle of energetic tradeoffs. We will then use this foundation to address why species and individuals vary in the pattern and tempo of development, reproduction, and senescence. In the process, we will address questions such as: Why do humans invest so much in offspring and what factors influence individual differences in parental investment? What is the function of menopause? What is the purpose of a prolonged juvenile period (i.e., childhood)? And when and why should the pace of development accelerate or slow down?

"Writing","WRT 380","Advanced Research Writing: Theories, Methods, Practices","Good research skills are critical to academic success.

This involves knowing how to use appropriate databases, source materials, and composing processes, as well as negotiating the values, genres, and languages of the scholarly communities in which one is researching. In this course, students will learn fundamentals of research methods, practice these methods in a series of integrated research and writing assignments, and engage in critical reflection about research and writing. Students will focus on an area of disciplinary interest to them, and practice these essential research and writing skills through a series of projects: library assignments, research log, research proposal, annotated bibliography, literature review, abstract, research paper and reflection paper.

"Writing","WRT 381","Advanced Analytic and Argumentative Writing","Argumentative writing involves making a claim and supporting it with specific, related points and appropriate evidence–in other words, it is thesis-driven writing.

This class, therefore, will focus on learning how to effectively utilize argumentative and counter-argumentative writing strategies. Students will explore an area of disciplinary interest to them through several stages–proposal, preliminary draft, multiple versions, literature review–culminating in a 20-30 page piece of writing in which they make a claim about a particular subject in that area of interest and support it with scholarly research and extensive elaboration. This course will fulfill the second half of the Writing Pre-Med/Pre-Health prerequisite. Covers the Interdisciplinary topic for the English major.

In addition to frequent low-stakes writing tasks, the course requires three high-stakes written projects: a literature review, a research proposal, and a grant application along with an abstract.

"Writing","WRT 392","Theories and Methods of Mentoring Writers","Closely examines the difficulties implicit in mentoring writers, with special consideration for the roles of cultural expectations and social dynamics on both the teaching of writing and writers themselves. In small groups and one-to-one interactions, students explore theories and practices upon which composition instruction and writing center work depend. Building on the understanding that writing is a recursive process (a cycle of planning, drafting, revising, and editing), students also learn to analyze and problem-solve issues that become barriers for effective writing and communication.
