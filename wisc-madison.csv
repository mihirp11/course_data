Surveys the entrenched modes of both conceptual and critical apprehension of the cultural forms and practices (from Negritude to postcolonialism and postmodernism), explores their methods of reading, raises the issue of their linkages to sources in Euro-America, and assesses the extent to which the unique concerns of the biography of culture in Africa (expressed by its creators and scholars) have tried to tame and refashion what are now globally shared critical tools of cultural reading.","African Cultural Studies (AFRICAN)","3 credits."

"ART HIST 102","SEEING THROUGH CONSPIRACY THEORIES","Fake news is not a new problem. In taking on this ongoing issue, we begin before living memory (to avoid the deadening effect of feedback loops within today's media world), with a focus on the visual and built environment. How do conspiracy theories work? Do they fall into patterns? How can we recognize them? If they are empowering, how should we think about that? Visual material plays a special role in the reinforcement of conspiracy theories. Case studies around the world, from the Egyptian pyramids to the birth of ""modern"" art in the twentieth century, center on ways in which an evidence-based account of the making of an artwork or architectural site has been replaced by a (usually more interesting) story about its true, hidden nature. This story usually purports to reveal the ""conspiracy"" of an empowered institution or group to keep the truth away from average people. Of course, the reality is often much simpler and the dynamics of power more complex.","Art History (ART HIST)","3 credits."

Examine India's global architectural histories not only through comparison but, in the words of historian Sanjay Subrahmanyam, ""by seeking out the at times fragile threads that connected"" India to ""the globe.""  Capturing the mobility of populations, traders, conquerors, missionaries, pilgrims, tourists, colonists, architects, artists, scholars, religion, merchandise, art, architecture, and ideas, we show that South Asia's global architectural histories are themselves the complex products of varied histories of cultural encounters.","Art History (ART HIST)","3 credits."

After studying the trails and trades that brought newcomers west, we reach key converging events: U.S. seizure of the Mexican North, resolution of the Oregon boundary dispute, discovery of western gold, West Coast arrival of Chinese immigrants, and Mormon exodus to the Great Basin.

"ENGL/​GEN&WS  401","RACE, SEX, AND TEXTS (HOW TO DO THINGS WITH WRITING)","Uses writing in many forms and genres to help students explore how race, gender, and sexuality intersect with language and inform textual experiences. From marriage licenses, passports, and don't ask, don't tell policies to literacy requirements and gag rules, written texts have played major roles in enforcing expectations about race and sex in the United States. At the same time, anti-slavery petitions, letters to the editor, wheat-pasted posters, and hashtag activism all also harness the power of writing to challenge and revise those expectations. In light of that active textual production and negotiation, this class traces public debates and daily experiences where people write or talk about race and sex in order to make a difference. Ultimately, the class takes on the power of words to break bones and heal wounds.

For example, a word like ""hopefulness is fine, while ""hopenessful"" does not exist. From a psycholinguistic perspective examine how children learn these formal properties as well as the meaning of words. Study how words are stored in the mind and what one can learn from situations in which one cannot access the mental dictionary properly (for example, when one feels a word is on ""the tip of one's tongue ).

If that question had been posed fifteen years ago, it would likely have been dismissed as unrealistic, undesirable, or just plain crazy. In recent years, however, the idea of introducing a universal basic income [UBI] has gained a lot of traction around the world. Growing inequalities, financial crises, fears about jobs being automated, and the COVID-19 pandemic have all helped to put UBI on the political map. But where did the idea come from? How is it traveling to different parts of the world? And on what grounds do different advocates justify their claims? Address these questions and more by exploring the history, philosophy, and political economy of UBI from a range of perspectives. Ongoing UBI experiments from different parts of the world will also be examined.","International Studies (INTL ST)","3 credits."

While it is impossible to cover every theoretical approach or Latin American case during the semester, the course should give students the tools to begin to think critically about where and why people engage in collective action. We will develop and hone these tools through thinking about Latin American cases, paying specific attention to revolutions, social movements, and riots. The course is designed in three parts. It begins by exposing students to the dominant theoretical paradigms in the study of contentious politics as well as some prominent critiques. The course then turns to empirical themes in Latin American revolutions, challenging students to use and question the theoretical tools to which they have already been exposed. The final part of the course looks to social movements in Latin America. Cases will focus on challenges to dictatorships, identity-based movements, and resistance to globalization.","International Studies (INTL ST)","3-4 credits."
"INTL ST/​POLI SCI  327","INDIAN POLITICS IN COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE","This course explores the socio-economic and political outcomes across India.

The course considers how India comports with standard theories in comparative politics and how standard theories might be revised in light of the Indian case. The course maps variation on the sub-national and regional level. The course will ultimately consider reforms proposed by the Indian state to further democratic and economic development and to reduce conflict.

"INTL ST/​HISTORY  332","EAST ASIA & THE U.S. SINCE 1899","From the Boxer Rebellion, to the dropping of the atomic bombs, to the nuclear stand-off with North Korea, American foreign relations with East Asia during the 20th century were as consequential as they were controversial. Survey the issues and questions that alternately made allies and enemies of these nations: How did the quest for markets influence American policy towards China? How did European imperialism shape Japan's rise? Why did communism seem to offer a more compelling economic and political arrangement to China and North Korea? While squarely rooted in East Asia this course will also explore the questions that united and divided Americans over their nation's foreign policy.

Its half-century history was marked by nuclear-armed stalemate and ideological competition in Europe, cultural politics of repression and generational revolt in America, interplay of anti-colonial nationalism and counterinsurgency in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and a succession of major wars worldwide in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, and Afghanistan.

Students will learn to perform institutional analysis as well as write a memorandum presenting such an analysis to a policymaker. Students will align their final projects to their personal and professional activities and/or their internship.

Can we ever recover and understand the beliefs and values held by people who lived in different countries and previous centuries? Draws on the disciplines of religious studies, history and literature to evaluate the different frameworks that scholars have used in their investigations of women's spiritual writing during the turbulent English civil wars (1642-1660). Unable to fight with swords or speak out in church because they were denied ordination, women raised their pens to express their partisanship in the conflict. Positioning themselves as faithful spouses and devout Christians, these women endorsed religious injunctions about feminine modesty and spirituality at the same time as they secretly worked as messengers and spies.
