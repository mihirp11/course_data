Why did Swedish firms help to introduce a free universal health care system? Why it is rational for German companies to grant their workers veto rights over management decisions, but not for U.S. firms? Clearly, labor rights, market regulations, and industrial organization differ significantly across the United States, Germany, and Sweden. Yet, economics as a social science typically does not incorporate these differences. On the other hand, political economy analyzes how factors such as the electoral system, degree of business coordination, and governmental regulation shape business strategy. Understanding the effect of these differences is essential for managers designing investment strategies or policy makers developing policy recommendations.

"IPEC 4313","Human Development Policy","3 semester credit hours","School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences","International Political Economy","IPEC 4313   Since the late 20th century, human development theory (HDT) has inspired the way that the world envisions and practices international development, particularly for marginalized peoples and communities. From large multilateral agencies like the World Bank, bilateral donors like USAID, international and national nonprofit organizations, governments, to grassroots civil society organizations, the definition and purpose of development is shifting. Today, much of work of key stakeholders like Malala's Fund, Partners in Health, Save the Children, DFiD, and the Millenium Development and Sustainable Development Goals (MDGs/SDGs) builds on the principles of HDT. This development approach considers ""namely, advancing the richness of human life, rather than the richness of the economy in which human beings live, which is only a part of it"". HDT seeks to improve individual capacities and human freedom. This course will introduce students to the history of international development policy in relation to the eventual promotion of HDT. Students will learn more about how international development policy, programs, agencies, nonprofits, and donors can work together to improve the quality of life with dignity for those who often face dire poverty, injustice, systemic violence, and insecurity.

The class will focus on the politics of government decisions surrounding illicit markets, including prohibition, enforcement, and international cooperation. Throughout the course, students will be challenged to think about the intersection of economic and security issues, alongside the applied public policy concerns around control different types of transnational crime. Topics will include several cross-border illicit markets such as illegal drugs, small arms, wildlife, and kidnapping. The class centers around understanding five questions about each topic: Who is gaining or losing from the illicit market? What stage is illegal (production, transit, consumption)?

The first section of the course deals with the way stock markets and banks operate in different countries. The second section analyzes how politics affects exchange rates and capital mobility. The final section of the course investigates sovereign debt and lending.

"PPOL 4305","Policy Analysis, Theory, and Methods","3 semester credit hours","School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences","Public Policy","PPOL 4305   This course offers a holistic overview of public policy analysis, theory, and practice. Policy analysts offer crucial advice based on carefully analyzing sources of relevant information through a variety of potential theoretical lenses and analysis techniques, which you will study throughout this semester. These recommendations are often client-oriented; pertinent to public decisions; contextual to time/place/culture; and influenced by key social values and political processes. Policy analysis is a tool to better identify and understand: 1) different points of view of a policy problem, 2) potential options for solving (or at least minimizing the negative effects) of the issue, 3) important steps and actors necessary to make change, and 4) the related probable outcomes, consequences, and uncertainties. This course hopes to inspire you to consider the larger implications that public policy may have. Good policy making can improve society and the quality of life of people, especially those who are in most need. But when done poorly, policies can just as easily injure individuals and groups, strip them of their rights, dignity, and quality of life, all the while benefiting a select few. In a time when our world is facing both immense new challenges (global warming, pandemics, etc.) and old social problems (racism, inequity, poverty, etc.), you can play a vital role in your chosen career to make a real difference to your community, nation, and beyond.
