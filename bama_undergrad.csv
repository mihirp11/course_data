US and Global Citizenship"
"AAST310","African American Organizing From 1877 to the Present: Defining Citizenship in America","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This course offers a semester-long exploration into the ways in which African Americans have mobilized and organized to define US citizenship in the struggle for civil rights from the late 19th century to the present. In this course, students will consider how race, gender identity, class, national identity, and/or historical moments have shaped the ways in which African Americans have organized and mobilized historically, and in doing so defined what we mean by citizenship in the society. What is the scope of political activism, what are the limits on personal liberty and political organization permitted in US society? Students will therefore also explore and interrogate the different strategies African Americans deployed in pursuit of these larger civil rights goals and what problems African Americans faced in their efforts to organize. Through a diverse set of readings, class discussion, and writing assignments, this course ultimately asks students to not only identify the range of movements led by African Americans for civil rights but ask and answer the question of what constitutes a movement and/or a movement leader, and what is meant today with the idea of citizenship.

"AAST329","20th Century Black History","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","The course surveys African American history from the end of Reconstruction to the present day. The course uses specific themes for each course semester, and is repeatable. An example of a theme is “Racism and Resistance in the 20th Century,” where the focus is on the production of racist ideas and how black communities resisted and/or reproduced these ideas in the US. This course employs an intersectional approach to African American history by intentionally including the experiences of women, LGBTQ communities, children, and others who have traditionally been relegated to the margins of African American history narratives. It will use a combination of music, film, and selected readings to build upon students’ prior understanding of African American history. Special Topics Course"
"AAST330","African Diasporic Music and US and Global Citizenship","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Black American music, as a reflection of the African diaspora, has always soundtracked, reflected, and reshaped the history of the United States.

US and Global Citizenship"
"AAST336","Concepts of Race and Racism","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Analysis of American social structure, demographic and institutional trends over time related to race and the description of racism. This course offers a critical introduction to the conditions of possibility for the complexity of contemporary thinking about race, with particular emphasis on 1) racial slavery and anti-blackness as ontological claims, 2) diasporic and anti/de colonial meditations as traveling theories, 3) convention and community as political claims, and 4) the relationship between race as an idea and citizenship. Students will begin the course with the working assumption that slavery is usually thought to be at the root of the problem of race and racism. In order to excavate this assumption, students will survey debates on 1) the origin and history of race and racism (from the Ancients to the early moderns); 2) the deployment of categories in contested proximity to race (from class to gender); and 3) the development of different conceptual paradigms (from double consciousness to political ontology) to parse the relationship between race and the world, how persons think of citizenship and community. Instead of resolving these debates, the problem-based approach will emphasize how the scope and framing of texts bear on present problematics. In doing so, students will learn to mobilize class readings as theoretical and historical tools in interpreting and interrogating responsibility toward the themes in relation to the idea of citizenship, US and Global, as a place holder for the problem of difference and sameness.

Students will read fiction, poetry, journalism, government reports, and other kinds of texts dealing with major political and social questions from this era. Students will track three themes in particular: how does the state take up ideas and arguments from academics, activists, and communities in its definition of citizenship? How were white American interests and beliefs as a specific problem of citizenship addressed by writers of this era? How did writers attempt to mobilize and radicalize black Americans and thereby redefine what was meant by citizenship in the society as the struggle wore on?. US and Global Citizenship"
"AAST375","Freedom Beyond Rights","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Feminism understands itself to be fundamentally liberatory - that is, concerned with increasing liberty, particularly (but not exclusively) of women. Feminist political theory often treats freedom within a liberal framework that prioritizes individual rights: for example, the right to control one’s reproductive health, the right to equal pay, or the right not to experience harassment. According to this framework, to be free is to enjoy one’s rights without interference or limitation. The aim of this course is to think about freedom beyond rights. Specifically, we will consider what it means to be a free political actor, whether freedom is the highest political good, whether, and how, freedom is compatible with other values, such as equality and justice, and how different kinds of politics, social norms, and modes of living might affect attempts to increase and experience freedom.

"CL222","Greek Roman Mythology","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Greek and Roman mythology is at the spiritual core of much of Western civilization. For the ancients, myth was a religion, a means of alleviating common fears, a way of adding structure to the world, and a means of communicating values from one generation to the next. For literary authors and dramatists from ancient times to now, myth has provided a mechanism for conveying the desired message and image to the reader’s mind. For material artists of all periods, myth has been a favorite subject matter. Thus, the investigation of myth should be undertaken early in one's studies in order to lay the foundation for understanding other cultural and artistic disciplines.

"CL235","History of Early Christianity","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","The course explores the history of Christian communities in Antiquity and the early Middle Ages (prior to the year 1000) through the analysis of the key events, figures, ideas, values, and texts that has shaped our understanding of what Christianity was in this period. This includes not only the overview of the beginnings of the Roman Catholic tradition, but also surveys of Byzantine and Eastern Christianities (Syriac, Coptic, Georgian, Armenian, Slavic, Arabic, and Ethiopian), as well as various movements that were eventually declared heterodox and suppressed. The course begins with an introduction in which students will discuss the historical, social, ethical, and intellectual factors that influenced the development of early Christianity, its cultural connections with Judaism and Hellenism, and the appearance of formative texts of Christianity. The subsequent class meetings will be organized chronologically; discussions will focus on the key historical narratives which help to acquire the better understanding of the developments of Early Christianity from within and without. The course will explore the formation of early Christian thought, values, ethics, and aesthetics as a response on the foundational needs of the human condition mediated by the historical realities of the ancient Mediterranean. Humanities, PW: Global Engagement"
"CL323","Alexander the Great,Then & Now","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","In this course, students examine the vision and impact of Alexander the Great, whose military expedition to North Africa and the Middle East offers a model of a stable political structure on a global scale. Alexander’s activity ranged from Greece to India. The world he encountered was as foreign, diverse, strange and occasionally averse to his Western sensibilities as it is to us today. Yet, his vision was to overcome xenophobic tendencies (both among the conquering Greeks and the conquered people) and create a global and inclusive empire that was enriched by the different races, cultures, religions and civilizations it encompassed. This course is broad in scope and content and takes a global perspective regarding the factors of Alexander’s success, emphasizing the history and appreciation of the Humanities, rather than simply the ability to perform tasks at the written level. The study of Alexander’s achievement cultivates an appreciation of history and the Humanities on a practical level, while developing the students’ ability to deal with questions of values, ethics, and aesthetics on a global and historical level.

"CL333","Greek Civilization: Myth, History, Culture","3-6","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This course is taught in Greece and aims at introducing students to the history and culture of Greece, from antiquity to the modern era. Greece is at the crossroads between Europe, Africa and the Middle East and, as a result, a variety of cultures have left their cultural marks in the area: Egyptian, Minoan, Roman Christian, Muslim and Jewish. Yet, in the course of time, the Greeks have developed their own particular civilization, which is characterized by tremendous inventions, discoveries and technological advancements that have impacted the Western world and its identity. The Greeks do not claim to have invented the wheel, but to have used it in order to give the world theater, art, architecture, the Golden Mean, geometry, the Parthenon, automated machines, medicine, philosophy, the first universities and, above all, democracy. Students participating in the Greece program learn about (i) the value of myths and legends associated with historical sites; (ii) the history and important events in every site; and (iii) the influence of Greek culture on the modern world.

We will explore how silvicultural treatments can influence stand structure and composition and how these changes influence timber quantity and quality, forest health, biodiversity, soil, and wildlife habitat among other features.  We will also focus on how silviculture is influenced by broader social, economic, and ecological issues. Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course.  A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.

"HY310","Age of the Samurai","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This course covers the history of Japan from earliest times to the period of the Meiji Restoration in 1868. For most of the period under discussion, Japan was a divided realm only nominally ruled by the emperor, while real power lay in the hands of the feudal lords who were occasionally controlled by a shogun (governor general) during the Kamakura and Ashikaga Periods from the late 12th to early 15th century. By the 16th century, power had fallen back into the hands of the feudal lords, backed up by their armed retainers, the samurai. The Period of the Sendoku Jidai was a time of civil war, in which these lords vied for power, and was only ended with the victory of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who formed the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1605. This regime lasted until its decline in the 1850s, and was replaced by the Meiji regime, which abolished feudalism in Japan altogether.

"HY328","United States of War: Society and Military since 1865","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This course will engage students in the study of war and American society since 1865. It is not a class about military strategy or foreign policy. Rather, students will survey the radiating impact of armed conflict and military service on individuals, communities, culture, and politics. And in the other direction, students will examine the ways fundamental features of American society (race, gender, class, citizenship, sexual orientation, and so on) influence the country’s military experience. To give shape to such a vast subject, students will organize their inquiry around three questions: How do Americans mobilize for, fight, and remember their wars? Together those dimensions describe a society in the throes of militarization and perhaps militarism and/or anti-militarism. Students will explore the difference between these ideas and assess which of them, if any, characterizes the United States in this period. These questions and terms will guide the course's main effort: to scrutinize the ways America’s experience with armed conflict has reflected and shaped broader truths about society in the past century.

Students will study their experiences; their encounters with one another, Europeans, and Africans; and the different histories that people have told about those experiences and encounters. Class materials, which include art, film, and fiction as well as history and anthropology, stress the diversity of Native lifeways as well as the ways in which the history of American Indians has often been ignored, changed, appropriated, and distorted, as well as reclaimed and re-evaluated over time. Some of the questions students will consider throughout the semester include: How much can students know about Indigenous peoples before they had an alphabetic written history? What can European sources teach about the Native peoples they encountered? How did the Natives of North America live before 1492? Does it make any sense to generalize about “Indians,” given that they include a large number of diverse peoples? How did contact with Europeans and Africans (and their diseases and technologies) change Native societies? How did Natives affect Europeans and Africans? Why did Native peoples lose ground (literally and figuratively) in the nineteenth century? How have Natives experienced and reacted to the changes of the twentieth century?

"HY338","History of Contemporary China, 1921-2000","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This course provides a general but analytic introduction to the development of contemporary China from 1921, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was founded, to 1949 when the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was founded, and on towards the present, concluding around the year 2000.  We will review key historical phenomena that distinguish contemporary China, particularly Marxist and Stalinist theories and their use by the CCP in varying circumstances not only to purse and carry out political revolution (1921-1949) but also political-economic developments after 1949. Such developments initially involved PRC state formation via agricultural transformation & large-scale Soviet-style industrialization accompanied by bureaucratization, the oppositional anti-bureaucratic thrust that eventually produced the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), the rebuilding of both the CCP & PRC after Mao’s death in 1976, the “second Communist Revolution” after 1978 associated with Deng Xiaoping, and the places of “intellectuals” in all of this.

It will not, in other words, focus solely on artists and music, but will situate them within their broader economic, social, cultural, and political contexts. Among the topics it will examine are the emergence of the “teenager” as a distinct stage of human development, the rapid expansion of youth culture in the relatively affluent postwar era, the cultural and musical influences on the Beatles and their contemporaries, the Beatles themselves and Beatlemania, the “British Invasion” bands of the 1964-66 era, the expanding musical horizons of pop music from 1966 onward: psychedelia, folk-rock,” “progressive,” “heavy metal,” and glam-rock; the punk movement and the circumstances giving rise to it, the spectrum of post-punk musical trends, including synthpop, industrial, the “new pop,” and the ska revival; techno and rave culture, and the “Britpop revival” of the 1990s.

"HY346","Epidemics! A History of Medicine","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","The history of medicine is the history of disease. Plague, bloody flux, yellow fever, the flu, cholera, ebola, smallpox, AIDS — at one time or another, each of these terms inspired terror. They’ve entered our otherwise flourishing civilizations and, like a wildfire, cut down men, women, children, rich, poor, religious, non-believers, even the healers themselves. Like phantoms, they disappeared as fast as they came; but once introduced to these mysterious visitors, no society remained unchanged. In this history of medicine, we examine six major epidemics over the last three thousand years. We’ll then turn to three epidemics of the present: cancer, healthcare-associated infections, and bioterrorism. How have humans responded to these threats? How has medicine adapted, if it has? What are our triumphs and when have we been unable to stop our invisible adversaries?. PW: Global Engagement"
"HY348","The History of Games","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","The goal of this course is to use games as a primary source, a “window” into portions of the human experience at various times and places, and to incorporate experiential learning by adding gameplay and rule discussion to scholarly readings and class discussion.

"HY379","History of Modern Argentina","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","From the time of its incorporation into the Spanish Empire, the land now known as Argentina has held out the promise of fabulous wealth and opportunity.  This potential made Argentina the foremost destination of European immigrants to Latin America in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, during which time it became one of the wealthiest nations in the world.  Many Argentines have anxiously awaited the day when their nation would be included among the ranks of “first world” or “civilized” nations, and they take great pride in their adoption and adaptation of European culture.  However, Argentina’s history has not always been so rosy.  Political violence, economic catastrophe, and social unrest define the modern Argentine experience as much as economic prosperity, industrialization, and the development of a rich and dynamic culture.   From the gauchos (Argentine cowboys) of the vast Pampas to the smoke-filled tango parlors, immigrant tenements, and factories of Buenos Aires, Argentina offers a fascinating case for examining the creation and sustainment of identity and nationality in Latin America.

We will examine some of the seminal texts in Anglo-American culture, and we will study foundational changes in British and American law, politics, and society. More than anything, though, this class will push you to answer the why questions about this history: why did people assent to the Reformation? Why did a Civil War break out? And, perhaps most importantly, why was this question so important: which do you fear more, tyranny or anarchy?   In doing so, students will be asked to do extra, independent research for all essay questions. They will also be asked to write a reflective piece at the end of the course about these very questions.

"PHL234","Social Philosophy","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","How should we live together? In this course, we seek to answer this question through moral assessment of the institutional rules and cultural norms that shape our interaction with others and the world around us. We specifically consider issues in the following two categories: I. Markets & consumption. In the modern-day economy, we must grapple with important issues concerning the responsibilities of individual consumers and corporations, what goods may be legitimately bought and sold in a free market, and how economic transactions between nations should be structured to count as fair. II. Violence. One of the features thought to make the state distinctive is that it has a monopoly over the legitimate use of force. Given this power, we will examine the legitimate use of violence by the government. Is the death penalty justified? Is the use of torture permissible under any circumstances? How should it deal with terrorists as opposed to traditional combatants in war?. Humanities"

What does it mean to be an ethical consumer?. Humanities"
"PHL294","Business Ethics","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","“Doing business” is something that permeates our lives.   As customers, employees, employers, business owners, and simply as members of a community, we stand in important business relevant relations to others, for which it is appropriate to ask questions about the ethical status of our actions.  Are we acting in ethically appropriate ways?  To answer this we need to know what principles should govern our actions and what justifies those principles.  In this course we will look at case studies in light of standard philosophical theories about what constitutes and justifies normative ethical principles and action. Humanities"

"PHL388","Art and Human Nature","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","The arts are seemingly found in all human cultures.  Why is this so?  Is art deeply embedded in what we might call “human nature”?  Philosophers have long thought about the arts in terms of human nature.  More recently, there are proposals that we can think about the arts “naturalistically” in terms of what the biological and human sciences tell us about human nature, and the very human tendencies to make and appreciate art of all kinds.  This naturalistic turn requires philosophical thinking first about how we should conceive art; second, how we can interpret and evaluate art, and third, how it functions in a variety of cultural and environmental contexts.  We will be looking first at some classical theories of art and human nature, then at some naturalistic/scientific theories of art.  Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.

"PHL426","The Science of Ethics","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Usually science and ethics are taken to be about different things: science is concerned with the facts - how things are; ethics is concerned with value - how things should be.  But science has increasingly come to study ethics itself: the grounds and foundation of our ethical thinking and practices in evolution, moral psychology, social psychology and human behavioral ecology.  While many philosophers think these scientific investigations of human ethics cannot tell us how we should live, what we should do and what is morally good or bad, others think we can use science to inform our ethics, in part by uncovering our biases and correcting our errors in how we think about ethical questions and topics. In this class we will begin with traditional approaches to ethics based on reason, intuition and faith, then turn to challenges to these approaches based on evolutionary thinking, psychology and human ecology.  Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.

"PHL430","Philosophy of Oppression","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","In this course we will study philosophical issues concerning oppression.  Students will take up questions about how we should understand social categories such as race and gender: for instance, what does it mean to belong to a certain race, or to be a man or woman? Students will consider the nature and explore the hallmarks of oppression.  In particular, significant attention will be devoted to three specific forms of oppression: racism, sexism, and sizism. The class will also consider questions of responsibility—such as whether victims of oppression have a responsibility to resist the oppressive circumstances they face—and questions concerning what forms of civil disobedience might be justified to combat oppression, and on what basis.

"PHL441","Law and Morality","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This course explores the philosophical and moral underpinnings of four fundamental areas in the law school curriculum: Contract, Property, Tort, and Criminal Law.  Landmark cases from each area will be examined, focusing upon philosophical analysis and moral evaluation of the law.  If contracts have the same moral relations that we describe as promises in our everyday social relations, how should that fact guide the principles we follow in contract law?  Is liability for negligence morally defensible considering that negligence doesn’t examine one’s intent?  Is property simply a system for regulating the control of assets, or do persons have a moral right to have things?  Are persons responsible for who they are—personality, values, and beliefs—in a way that morally justifies punishing them for committing offenses?  This is a Writing (“W”) designated course. Written assignments require coherent, logical, and carefully edited prose. Writing"
"PHL442","Ticking Time Bombs: Philosophy and National Security","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","As the “ticking time bomb” hypothetical typically goes, you are an intelligence agent or law enforcement officer who has detained the one terrorist with knowledge of how to prevent a large-scale attack. One may contort the hypothetical to make it as heart-rending as possible, but the ultimate question is whether you should torture the detainee in such an extreme scenario.  These scenarios raise pressing practical and philosophical questions, but they need not be so extreme.  This course examines the central legal and philosophical issues relating to national security, including terrorism, torture, the ethics of intelligence, the national security uses and risks of artificial intelligence, and the balance between security and liberty.

"PHL472","Naturalism in Philosophy","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Naturalism in philosophy is a very general approach committed to the view that philosophical understanding is best achieved through careful consideration of the world in which we live, and those things and processes we observe in that world. Many naturalists believe that science and philosophy are closely related, and that they are ""continuous."" If so, then philosophy can share in the successes of science. This course will begin with a historical survey of naturalist philosophies, from Thales and Aristotle to modern approaches based on evolutionary thinking, pragmatism, and the human sciences - psychology, neuroscience, ecology and more. Students will look at prominent naturalistic approaches to metaphysics (what exists), epistemology (the grounds of knowledge), ethics, political theory, and aesthetics. "
"PHL475","Probability and Decision Theory","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Uncertainty is a fundamental and unavoidable feature of daily life. Agents must reason and act in an uncertain world. In order to do so intelligently, they need to deal with and reason about this uncertainty. This course discusses modeling and reasoning about uncertainty, going from purely qualitative notions (an event is either possible or it is not) to quantitative notions such as probability (an event has probability .8).  Students will learn different rules for making decisions under ignorance, given uncertainty, and in competition with others.

"PHL489","Philosophy of Medicine","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","It is difficult to overstate the significance of medicine, in that it affects each of us from birth through death; or the complexity of medicine, in that it involves scientific, conceptual, economic, ethical and philosophical issues.   We will here look at three of these issues from a philosophical standpoint: 1) the ways that we conceptualize health and disease; 2) the relation between medicine and science, and the patterns of reasoning associated with medical thinking; 3) the challenge posed by evolution to how we think about medicine, health and disease.

"PSC333","Elections Around the World ","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Elections have become a near-universal phenomenon in today’s politics. In democracies, elections allow citizens to choose their representatives and express their (dis)satisfaction with the government’s policies. Many non-democratic regimes also hold elections; these elections allow the authoritarian leaders to present themselves as legitimate but may occasionally result in a genuine democratization. In all contexts, elections test the government's popularity and can function as a rallying point for the opposition. This course examines electoral systems, turnout, and voting behavior around the world, examining several key questions: Why do people bother to vote? How do they decide which candidates or parties to support? How are their votes translated into electoral and policy outcomes? How can elections be manipulated? What are the roles of elections in authoritarian regimes?. "

How do the parties involved see that conflict, and how does it fit into our own conceptions of religion and politics, war and peace, place and space?  Why does it seem so intractable?  Why does it occupy such prominence in contemporary political discourse?   Through an examination of primary and secondary historical texts, literary works, films and artwork, we will explore the origins and unfolding of this conflict both internally (ie, as emerging from within distinct social-political moments for the people involved) and externally (in relation to broader geopolitical and economic developments).  As the conflict remains ongoing, we will strive for compassionate, nuanced engagement; to understand rather than judge; and to find hope for new possibilities. Prerequisite(s):Background in Middle Eastern politics is not required, but will be of benefit"

"PSC368","Interest Group Politics","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This class provides an in-depth examination of the purpose and influence of interest groups in American politics. At the simplest level, interest groups are organizations that try to influence government. Students will start the semester exploring the role of interest groups in the American polity, why and how groups form, who joins groups and why, and how groups survive. Students will then investigate questions of influence; specifically what groups have influence and to what end. While looking at influence, students will consider the relationship between interest groups and political and linkage institutions. Our look at interest group activities will lead us through topics such as lobbying, political action committees (PACs), campaign contributions, protest, and the like. Students will consider normative questions about the role of groups, such as, do they undermine democracy or enhance it, and consider empirical questions, such as what influence do groups really have?. "
"PSC369","Social Movements and U.S. Politics","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","In this course we will examine the causes and consequences of social movements in U.S. politics. Although social scientists have defined “social movements” in somewhat different ways, we will rely on a relatively simple definition that reflects the shared elements of all of the definitions found in the literature. Social movements are collective, organized efforts of non-state actors to promote or resist change, that rely in whole or in part on unconventional political tactics. Throughout U.S. history, it is difficult to identify major examples of policy change that were not spurred by social movement activity. Yet, social movements remain the least studied form of political influence within the discipline of political science. Therefore, much of the material from this course will draw from the fields of sociology and history, where the majority of the research on social movements can be found. PW: Exec Systems  Structures"
"PSC370","American Public Policy","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This course provides a broad overview of public policy in the United States.

"
"PSC373","Voting and Political Participation","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Voting and political participation explores what motivates people to engage in politics. Students will learn about the costs of abstention, or the costs that people bear for not participating in politics. Turning the usual “cost-benefit” calculus on its head, students will instead consider the conditions under which “sitting out” of politics is unbearable. Then, students look specifically at young voters. This research explores whether the political motivations of young and older voters are different and why they vote at different rates. Finally, students investigate why people prefer certain candidates over others, along with why campaigns try and target “persuadable” voters. Taken together, students will leave the course with a better appreciation for why citizens bear the costs to get involved in the messy work of politics. "
"PSC374","Media and Politics","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This course explores research on the relationship between the media and politics. Substantively, this corner of academia involves a diverse mix of disciplines, ranging from the economics of news production (business, economics), to media effects (advertising, psychology), to journalistic practices (ethics), and even the ways in which institutions shape behavior (politics). In turn, the study of media and politics is also methodologically diverse, incorporating experiments, surveys, web-scraping, and even qualitative analysis. Over the semester term, students will read widely – from histories of the media, to empirical analysis of how the media shapes what people know about politics. Throughout this work, students will be encouraged to pay special attention to the role that media and technology play in shaping how citizens practice democracy. "
"PSC375","Election Reform in America","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Free and fair elections are the backbone of a healthy democracy. As such, election rules and administration constitute an area of public policy where states continuously experiment and implement new reforms. From online voting registration, to redistricting, to mail voting, there is no scarcity of proposals for improvement. However, motivations behind these reforms are varied and their implications are somehow controversial. Are American elections working well? Why is there a need for electoral reform? How have these reforms affected turnout, representation, and voter behavior? What are the benefits and drawbacks of these reforms? This course will rely on these prominent questions, while focusing on specific election reforms. "
"PSC376","Political Participation","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","This course will focus on key issues in political participation and its implications for democracy. While the primary focus will be on political participation in the United States, some parts of the course will include a comparative element. This course is designed to expose students to both foundational and recent literature in political participation and provide a general overview of the determinants of political participation in America. More specifically, throughout the semester, we will discuss questions such as: Who participates in politics, who doesn’t, and why? What are the different types of political participation? What encourages participation, and what suppresses it? How does political participation affect social inequalities? How do institutions affect participation? Most importantly, does political participation eve matter? During our discussions, students will pay close attention to methods: how scholars theorize, design research, and present evidence. "

Over the last hundred years, Russia has experienced major political transformations, many of them with consequences extending beyond its borders. In order to understand these upheavals and their impact on contemporary Russian politics, students will draw upon theories of political development and comparative regime transitions. At the core of this course is the crucial puzzle: why did Russia return to non-democratic politics just a few years after throwing off seven decades of one-party rule? Students will trace Russia's past to understand its present: the Soviet system, Gorbachev's perestroika, the collapse of the USSR, the troubled birth of new Russia, and Putin's rise to power.

"PSC472","Law in Everyday Life:   Theory & Application","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Law is traditionally studied vocationally.  That is, students of the law often learn about it strategically, in order to eventually write legislation, advocate for a client, or decide cases.  In this class, students will be introduced to a different way of studying law, one rooted in the interdisciplinary field of legal studies (sometimes known as “law and society”) that draws on knowledge, methodologies, and critical theories from several disciplines.  Rather than studying law as an enterprise that operates autonomously, this course introduces students to the study of law as an object that cannot be understood apart from the social, political, and cultural contexts in which it exists, to include race and ethnicity, social class, gender, sexual orientation, and nationality.  With these goals in mind, this course will explore how law permeates human life and, conversely, how human life permeates law.     As this course is one that satisfies the “W” requirement, writing proficiency within this discipline is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.

We will begin the course with the working assumption that slavery is usually thought to be at the root of the problem of race and racism. In order to excavate this assumption, we will survey debates on 1) the origin and history of race and racism (from the Ancients to the early moderns); 2) the deployment of categories in contested proximity to race (from class to gender); and 3) the development of different conceptual paradigms (from double consciousness to political ontology) to parse the relationship between race and the world, how we think of citizenship and community. Instead of resolving these debates, our problem-based approach will emphasize how the scope and framing of texts bear on present problematics.

"
"WS375","Freedom Beyond Rights","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Feminism understands itself to be fundamentally liberatory - that is, concerned with increasing liberty, particularly (but not exclusively) of women. Feminist political theory often treats freedom within a liberal framework that prioritizes individual rights: for example, the right to control one’s reproductive health, the right to equal pay, or the right not to experience harassment. According to this framework, to be free is to enjoy one’s rights without interference or limitation. The aim of this course is to think about freedom beyond rights. Specifically, we will consider what it means to be a free political actor, whether freedom is the highest political good, whether, and how, freedom is compatible with other values, such as equality and justice, and how different kinds of politics, social norms, and modes of living might affect attempts to increase and experience freedom. "
"WS405","Feminist Theory 1600-1960s","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","The history of political thought has long been equated with the history of men’s political thought, with women excluded from the intellectual and public spheres. Yet it would be a grievous mistake to assume that women (including all who identify as such) were not actively engaged in debating issues of gender, sexuality, race, and class before the advent of modern feminism. Indeed, one of contemporary feminist scholars’ greatest tasks has been to recover a long and rich history of ideas and texts written by and about women. This course utilizes primary materials and focuses on women’s contributions to the history of political thought between 1400 and 1914. "
"WS407","Contemporary Feminism","3","College of Arts & Sciences Courses","Political theory has traditionally associated men with citizenship, public life, and affairs of state, while subordinating or ignoring women’s interests, experiences, and voices. Feminist political theory challenges this imbalance, while also expanding the boundaries of what ought to be considered “political.” Motivated by a concern for inequality in everyday life, feminist political theory seeks to provide a philosophical framework with which to address injustice, while also inquiring about the existential condition of those who identify as women, trans*, or genderqueer. In so doing, feminist political theory pries open the category of “woman” to reveal its complexities, contradictions, and promise. Students will read influential works from contemporary feminist scholars who come from a variety of intellectual traditions and possess differing political commitments. These texts not only disrupt the historic exclusion of women from political theory but also the exclusionary tendencies in some early feminist writing. Topics may include justice, oppression, solidarity, the state, and neoliberalism. PW: Global Engagement"

Moreover, the land is awash with the vestiges of Arab and Kemetic influences. They are found in the history, in the architecture, the ruins, and most importantly, embodied within the people. In this way, Egypt is a study in conflict and contact and change and continuity. While recognizing the importance of Arab rule in Egypt from the 7th century, this course will focus on the contributions of Africana people to the fabric of ancient and modern Egypt. This seminar will provide students with an induction to Egyptian history, culture, and society from the earliest pottery producing cultures of the Neolithic Period (starting c. 8000 BC) through the early development of the Egyptian state (c. 3000 BC), to the Islamic conquest (639 CE).

It encapsulates the Renaissance spirit of eloquence, and four hundred years after its publication, it remains the most frequently used translation of the Bible in the English-speaking world, especially in America. Given the historical, political, literary, and cultural prominence of this translation, this course takes a transdisciplinary approach to understanding how the book came into existence and what accounts for its popularity. The course begins by studying the complex history of how this translation came to be commissioned, who the translators were, how the translation was accomplished, and the politics involved in the translation. The course then critically studies the structures and styles of the KJB, with particular focus on examining genres and performing close readings of texts, as well as considering the political work often attributed to the text (i.e., how the book has been used to enslave and emancipate enslaved people, how it has been used to create and maintain patriarchy, etc). The course ends by paying particular attention to the history of the KJB in the United States, as we discuss the so-called “KJB-Only Movement.” Therefore, rather than studying Jewish or Christian theology, this course aims to introduce students to issues surrounding the material book history of the KJB, its immense literary aesthetic, and its cultural influence.

"UH244","Women: Antiquity to Modernity","3","Honors College Courses","This course examines the impact of the ancient world on the life of modern women. More specifically, this course examines the evolution of women’s life, starting from ancient Greece and following its trajectory to the modern day. Ancient Greece, known for catapulting civilization to higher levels with its invention of democracy, political science, philosophy, the codification of laws and the professionalization of medicine among other achievements, shaped the world, for better or worse, as it is known today. This same culture, however, has excluded women from public life since the 5th century BC and has set the stage for pioneer women in the West to combat the perception of females as inferior beings and to struggle to enter higher education and public life and, eventually, gain voting rights. This socio-political framework helps to explore the gender ideologies that have impacted women’s life since antiquity, the changes in the perception of women in the course of history, the origin and development of ideas about women’s body and mind, as well as the role of race in regard to these issues. Understanding the gamut of theories and attitudes toward women, students can develop a better grasp of what women want today, where they are headed, what obstacles are still standing in their way and how they can overcome them to achieve their goals.

Are the terms bound by racial, ethnic, or spatial limitations? Who possesses the rights of access to the cultural products and expressions unique to the continent and her descendants? In this course, students will examine how the concept of Africa, as both home and identity, is recreated and imagined through a variety of disciplines and sources (history, sociology, religion, art, media studies, anthropology, psychology, linguistics). During lectures and weekly discussions, and through words, pictures, sounds, and live performance, they will examine objects and stories that collectively make up contemporary expressions of global Africanity. Students will explore questions of home, identity, Afropolitanism, continuity, appropriation, authenticity, historical memory, and creolization using examples from academic scholars, literary figures, and popular culture.

"UH312","Fear and the American Consciousness","3","Honors College Courses","This course seeks to answer two questions: “What do Americans fear, and what can we learn about American culture after studying that fear?” Americans have always, and perhaps now more than ever, maintained deep fear. Fear of the unknown. Of science. Of technology. Of others. Of terrorism. Of gun violence. Of viruses. Of each other. Answering such questions demands a transdisciplinary approach to fear. Therefore, students will use trauma theory, psychology, science, race theory, historical analysis, philosophy, rhetoric studies, sociology, film criticism, and gender theory to analyze fear from a variety of disciplines. The class is organized around a series of texts that depict and address American fears since the Great Depression, and students will be asked to analyze and then debate the causes of such fears.

Conversely, how might the reflective, imaginative craft of writing influence the practice of medicine? More specific questions to be explored might include: how do William Carlos Williams’ twin vocations of rural doctor and poet set him apart from his literary contemporaries?  How might the archetypal characters of Holmes and Watson represent the balance doctors must strike between reason and empathy in the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle?
