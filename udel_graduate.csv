Topics will be explored from the perspective of modern imaging techniques and will draw heavily on evidence of neuroimaging studies. Study of experimental studies will consider brain bases of language through the lens of healthy language processing and neurogenic language disorders.  The information gained in this course will permit students to recognize the neural underpinning of language through the discussion and critique of relevant topics via experimental design. As we progress through this course, particular value will be placed on understanding how the neural basis of language sheds light on the cognitive mechanisms of language processing and how it can inform treatment of language impairments.Repeatable for Credit:NAllowed Units:3Multiple Term Enrollment:NGrading Basis:Student OptionCrosslisted:May be crosslisted withLING 602.

The course will examine various forms of “expressive culture” including adornment practices, beauty culture, performance, music, dance, sport, and photography. In addition, the course will highlight the crucial intersections among these expressive cultures and major social and political movements in post-emancipation era Afro-diasporic communities. While the course is designed for historians, it explicitly incorporates scholarship in other disciplines to encourage students to develop interdisciplinary approaches to the study of Afro-diasporic expressive culture. In this manner, students will be encouraged to tackle the following semester-long challenge: How can scholars productively employ interdisciplinary approaches to the histories of Afro-diasporic cultural production? Thus, the class invites students to familiarize themselves with the distinct, yet interconnected scholarship on Afro-diasporic cultural production in a manner that highlights the movement of cultural practices across the Americas.

Why do we have environmental problems? What are their causes? Which groups are most vulnerable to environmental issues and why do these injustices persist? What shapes our ideas about relationships between humans and their environments? How does narrative shape our ideas about the “human” and interrogate its global impacts?  Orbiting around these central questions, this course explores approaches to environmental problems that recognize “nature” and “culture” as inseparable, and that foreground questions of justice, uneven risk, and intersections between environmental change and globalization.  Reading across disciplinary and generic boundaries, we will think through the relationships between these disciplines and genres, in different ways.

We then examine what role, if any, racial or ethnic attachments play in shaping decision making and behavior across a range of political arenas. As we grapple with the central theoretical and thematic debates that have characterized the study of race and ethnic politics, we will also strongly consider the significance of identity politics more broadly.
