"EDGM697","Graduate","Teaching, Learning and Leading: Effective Mathematics Instruction for All Students","2","Education - Mathematics","For all students to gain mathematical proficiency, schools, teacher leaders and teachers must address key issues at both the classroom and system level.   First, they must complete the shift from math teaching as computational and symbol manipulation to instruction that builds deep understanding of foundational mathematical concepts to a level that supports transfer of knowledge to higher levels of mathematics, to mathematics for citizenship and daily life, and to the mathematics demanded in today’s workplace. Second, they must change mathematics instruction that, for the most part, continues to be based on showing and telling, to instruction characterized by orchestrating learning through engaging tasks that require students to grapple and persevere (Leinwand, 2012). Although these features of highly effective mathematics instruction have been known for decades, if all students are to learn important mathematics the charge is to move from “localized pockets” of instructional excellence to “systemic excellence.” (Principles to Action, 2014).   Research suggests that the greatest influence on how a teacher teaches is what and how they were taught (Ball, D, 1988).  This suggests that all math teachers and the leaders that support individual and systemic change must first experience, learn and understand deeply the ways they must teach their students. Finally, “Teachers are among the most powerful influences in learning” (Hattie, 2012). Thus, the promise of highly effective mathematics instruction for all students is dependent upon deeply knowledgeable, capable and accomplished teachers and math leaders across systems.    
 

This course is the first in the program’s multi-course sequence focusing on mathematics teaching and learning. It is designed to introduce and examine concepts that form the foundation of highly effective instruction across grades K-8.

"EDGM705","Graduate","Statistics II for Teachers","2","Education - Mathematics","As discussed by Moore and Cobb (1997), “Statistics is a methodological discipline.  It exists not for itself, but rather to offer to other fields of study a coherent set of ideas and tools for dealing with data.  The need for such a discipline arises from the omnipresence of variability.”  The Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) Report, endorsed by the American Statistical Association, is the authoritative report that guides curricular decisions in K-12 and college education. The GAISE report describes this focus on the omnipresence of variability as the distinguishing feature of statistics education and the idea that sets statistics apart from mathematics.  As described in the report (2005), “a major objective of statistics education is to help students develop statistical thinking.  Statistical thinking, in large part, must deal with this omnipresence of variability; statistics problem solving and decision making depend on understanding, explaining, and quantifying the variability in the data.” (p. 6) 

This course provides an introduction to inferential statistics with an emphasis on statistical concepts and measures related to educational assessment. Participants apply their understanding of both descriptive and inferential statistics to interpret and critique educational research studies and analyze and interpret summative and formative assessment results.  This course is designed to prepare teachers to lead their schools in understanding the meaning and appropriate uses of educational assessment data.

If possible, the mentor and student should take advantage of a residency to discuss the manuscript face-to-face.

During the initial conference, the mentor and student discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the manuscript and decide on goals for the semester ahead. Every kind of revision and rewriting is on the table. That is, the mentor and student might decide that an entire manuscript should be scrapped and started over. On the other side of the spectrum, they might decide on a course of line-level revisions. 

From that point forward the student submits 30 pages of creative manuscript every five weeks, for a total of four additional submissions. The mentor’s responses to these submissions should center on marginalia and phone conferences, with thorough line-by-line edits and comments responding to passages. The mentor’s responses should be like those of an excellent, devoted, unusually hands-on book editor. There should be a great deal of conversation; the responses to the packets should not be one-way instruction. This reflects the fact that the student has already completed an MFA program and is a somewhat experienced writer, in all likelihood preparing the manuscript for submission to literary agents.

But personally, our ideas about gender, our conceptions of sex, and our understanding of love are consistently a source of intense emotional responses and meaning in our lives, for better and for worse. Still, despite their centrality, it is common for us to adopt our notions of love, sex, and gender unthinkingly, and simply assume that our received accounts of them are natural, fixed and unproblematic.
