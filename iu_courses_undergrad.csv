"School of Humanities and Social Sciences","undergraduate","ENG-W 215","Introduction to Rhetoric","3 cr.","Since its inception in the fifth century BCE, rhetoric has been a powerful force in public affairs, education, politics, and in the practice of civic life. Its impact on the epistemological foundations of Western societies cannot be overstated and, until around the middle of the nineteenth century, rhetoric dominated formal education in Europe and the United States. To study the history of rhetoric is to catch a glimpse of the evolution of ideas, politics, and-in short-ways of being together in the world as they have developed since the time of the ancient Greeks.Â  This course will introduce you to some of the major figures and concepts in the history of rhetoric and rhetorical thought, beginning with rhetoric's emergence in Classical Greece as a systematic pedagogy and practice of civic participation (being together) and then moving on to some more recent conversations in rhetorical theory. In addition to studying rhetoric's rich history of ideas and figures-what we might call the ""content"" of rhetorical history-we will also be concerned with studying the connections among and between various theories of language, politics, culture, power, social identities, and civic action. Since rhetoric was originally conceived as above all a productive art, one of the guiding concerns of our discussions this semester will be to ask, ""What might rhetoric do for us in our present circumstances?"""

"School of Sciences","Health Sciences","HSCI-H 273","Cultural Gustatory Perceptions","3 cr.","Gustatory, medically, refers to the sense of taste.Â  The sense of taste helps identify food and forms a taste preference, although the appeal of both sweet- and salty-tasting substances, in large part at least, is innately determined (Beauchamp and Cowart, 1985).Â  Gustatory behaviors, such as neophobia and taste aversion learning, suggest that the gustatory information from the taste buds is compared to gustatory memories at all times during food intake, and thus we avoid ingesting novel or harmful food. Gustatory memories enable us to generate vivid perceptions of taste in the absence of peripheral gustatory inputs. Thus, not only signals from the peripheral gustatory nervous system but also those obtained by recalling gustatory memories play a critical role for gustatory information processing. Designed on one hand to examine food preferences, delicacies and taboos tied to some of the world's most unusual sources of sustenance, the course isÂ  also crafted to connect the simple acts of eating, no matter how unusual the product or preparation, with the supper table's intricate links to culture, identity, politics and economics.
