Using both a theoretical and applied approach, we will analyze how historical and contemporary realities of women of color are influenced by a legacy of structural inequalities. The approach to this course will pay particular attention to sociological aspects of identity as well as cultural representations that are manifestations of systems of oppression. Finally, the course moves beyond intersectionality as “identity politics” and examines the ways in which power is deployed through interlocking systems of oppression including white supremacy, patriarchy, and advanced capitalism.

We’ll also look at how racism connects with other social categories such as Indigeneity, gender, sexuality, disability, religion and class.

Although thoroughly debunked and are more widely condemned than ever, it nevertheless continues to surface in government policies, popular representations, and brutal acts of violence. What is it that makes racism so intractable? This course works to answer that question by analyzing racism as a problem that’s deeply em-bedded in Western societies, albeit similarly prevalent in many non-Western countries. We’ll also look at how racism connects with other social categories such as Indigeneity, gender, sexuality, disability, religion and class. And in addition to considering how racism has oper-ated to oppress, exclude and scapegoat, we’ll also be attentive to how marginalized groups have fought back.

Maroons and their communities, or communities of those some would call “runaway slaves,” were an ever-present feature of slaveholding societies throughout the Americas. Everywhere they existed, from Brazil to Jamaica, from Virginia to Suriname, or from Mexico to Haiti, they proved the indomitable spirit of African people and their descendants, and the great failures of the institution of slavery. Throughout the course, we will look closely at the demographic, economic, and geographic opportunities for enslaved mobility and resistance that shaped the formation of the Atlantic world. The central focus will be an analysis of the historical impact of marronage across the Americas from 1502 to 1865.  N 3 N Student Option  May be crosslisted with HIST 462  .

"Women and Gender Studies","WOMS 342","Black Women’s History to 1865","BLACK WOMEN’S HISTORY TO 1865  Lecture  This course brings into focus the lived experiences of Black women throughout United States history through the end of the Civil War. Beginning with the first African women to encounter North American shores in the 17 th century, Black women’s knowledge, creativity, activism, and community leadership have been integral to both Black people’s perseverance, and to the evolution of this country. Throughout this course, Black women’s voices will be central. We will read Black women’s writing, examine the ways Black women fashioned their own bodies, and we will survey Black women’s art throughout this early period. We will examine a wide range of sources including periodicals, slave narratives, memoir/autobiography, oral history, poetry, visual art, film, and music, in addition to assigned secondary literature. In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women’s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism. A primary goal will be to consider how Black women have worked to determine their own lives and possess their own bodies while other groups have sought to dominate and control them.

Using both a theoretical and applied approach, we will analyze how historical and contemporary realities of women of color are influenced by a legacy of structural inequalities. The approach to this course will pay particular attention to sociological aspects of identity as well as cultural representations that are manifestations of systems of oppression. Finally, the course moves beyond intersectionality as “identity politics” and examines the ways in which power is deployed through interlocking systems of oppression including white supremacy, patriarchy, and advanced capitalism.

How can we tell if ads are racist, and whether sports team owners are using code words to appeal to racial prejudices? Is kneeling for the anthem to protest the treatment of Black Americans unpatriotic? Are race-conscious policies really necessary? Should Black athletes use sports to protest socio-political issues? Seek to answer these questions and more by studying the systemic forms of oppression and discussing various cultural perspectives in an atmosphere of intellectual rigor and mutual respect for opposing views. Develop your understanding race by using the context of sport to explore many salient issues in American society such as racism, blind patriotism, capitalism, sexism, violence, oppression, etc. Enhance your critical thinking skills, information literacy skills, and your ability to place historical and contemporary issues in proper context.

Although thoroughly debunked and are more widely condemned than ever, it nevertheless continues to surface in government policies, popular representations, and brutal acts of violence. What is it that makes racism so intractable? This course works to answer that question by analyzing racism as a problem that’s deeply embedded in Western societies, albeit similarly prevalent in many non-Western countries. We’ll also look at how racism connects with other social categories such as Indigeneity, gender, sexuality, disability, religion and class. And in addition to considering how racism has operated to oppress, exclude and scapegoat, we’ll also be attentive to how marginalized groups have fought back.

How have theatre artists and playwrights used this form across time and cultures to speak deeply to their concerns of the day?   These questions are at the heart of this course and will come up every day as we encounter each new play, historical period and culture.  This is a basic introduction to the dramatic literature of the central cultures of the world: European, Asian, Latin, African, American and Arabian.  A main focus of this course will be the intersection of art and society.  We (the professor and the students) will all be engaged in making connections between the plays, contemporary issues and the students’ lives. While theatre will be central to the course, many of the other arts will play a part as the definition of theatre in many cultures includes dance, shadow play, puppets, music, singing, ceremony and image making.

Although thoroughly debunked and are more widely condemned than ever, it nevertheless continues to surface in government policies, popular representations, and brutal acts of violence. What is it that makes racism so intractable? This course works to answer that question by analyzing racism as a problem that’s deeply embedded in Western societies, albeit similarly prevalent in many non-Western countries. We’ll also look at how racism connects with other social categories such as Indigeneity, gender, sexuality, disability, religion and class. And in addition to considering how racism has operated to oppress, exclude and scapegoat, we’ll also be attentive to how marginalized groups have fought back.

Although thoroughly debunked and are more widely condemned than ever, it nevertheless continues to surface in government policies, popular representations, and brutal acts of violence. What is it that makes racism so intractable? This course works to answer that question by analyzing racism as a problem that’s deeply embedded in Western societies, albeit similarly prevalent in many non-Western countries. We’ll also look at how racism connects with other social categories such as Indigeneity, gender, sexuality, disability, religion and class. And in addition to considering how racism has operated to oppress, exclude and scapegoat, we’ll also be attentive to how marginalized groups have fought back.

"History","HIST 252","Violence in History: Achilles to ISIS","VIOLENCE IN HISTORY  Open with glorification and uses of violence in antiquity before turning to more critical analyses of violence as a type of text that can and is intended to be read and understood. Issues that include the reliance of the state on violence as means to communicate authority and power as well as the church’s use of violence to maintain authority and uniformity of belief in the name of God will form a bridge to more modern events like colonialism and imperialism. Once it was clearly established as an instrument for conveying and enforcing civilization and superiority violence soon took on a more direct and varied role in the mission civilsatrice. The acts became ever more specific with destruction of cultural memory and the humiliation of the victims and their material culture increasingly common. In time, the oppressed came to rely on violence as a weapon to strike back at (and communicate with) their enemies. Indeed, these very exchanges make it clear how well the texts of violence were understood by both sides of the conflict.

We will assess a wide range of historical sources including periodicals, state mandates, runaway slave advertisements, and slave narratives, in addition to assigned secondary literature.

"History","HIST 462","Maroons and Marronage in the Atlantic World","MAROONS IN THE ATLANTIC WORLD  Lecture  This course examines the hemispheric history of maroons and marronage in slaveholding Latin America, the Caribbean, and the United States. Maroons and their communities, or communities of those some would call “runaway slaves,” were an ever-present feature of slaveholding societies throughout the Americas. Everywhere they existed, from Brazil to Jamaica, from Virginia to Suriname, or from Mexico to Haiti, they proved the indomitable spirit of African people and their descendants, and the great failures of the institution of slavery. Throughout the course, we will look closely at the demographic, economic, and geographic opportunities for enslaved mobility and resistance that shaped the formation of the Atlantic world. The central focus will be an analysis of the historical impact of marronage across the Americas from 1502 to 1865.  N 3 N Student Option  Crosslisted with AFRA 462  .

Topics will be explored from the perspective of modern imaging techniques and will draw heavily on evidence of neuroimaging studies. Study of experimental studies will consider brain bases of language through the lens of healthy language processing and neurogenic language disorders.  The information gained in this course will permit students to recognize the neural underpinning of language through the discussion and critique of relevant topics via experimental design.
