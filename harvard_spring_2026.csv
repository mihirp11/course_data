Creativity,GENED 1067,FAS,General Education,"Where does creativity come from, how does it work, and how can we deepen its role in our own lives?Geniuses are said to possess it. Self-help books offer to teach it. Both the arts and the sciences celebrate it. It sits at the heart of some of our oldest myths and is the subject of up-to-the-minute neuroscientific research.

Unity and Division,GENED 1202,FAS,General Education,"How can diverse societies be successful?Diversity is a fundamental problem and fundamental advantage of the human condition.

The Art of Criticism,ENGLISH CACD,FAS,English,"This course will consider critical writing about art–literary, visual, cinematic, musical, etc.—as an art in its own right. We will read and discuss criticism from a wide variety of publications, paying attention to the ways outlets and audience shape critical work. The majority of our readings will be from the last few years and will include pieces by Joan Acocella, Andrea Long Chu, Jason Farago, and Carina del Valle Schorske. Students will write several short writing assignments (5"
Advanced Screenwriting: Workshop,ENGLISH CALR,FAS,English,"The feature-length script is an opportunity to tell a story on a larger scale, and, therefore, requires additional preparation. In this class, we will move from writing a pitch, to a synopsis, to a treatment/outline, to the first 10 pages, to the first act of a feature screenplay. We will analyze produced scripts and discuss various elements of craft, including research, writing layered dialogue, world-building, creating an engaging cast of characters. As an advanced class, we will also look at"

Intermediate Poetry: Workshop,ENGLISH CBBR,FAS,English,"Initially, students can expect to read, discuss, and imitate the strategies of a wide range of poets writing in English; to investigate and reproduce prescribed forms and poetic structures; and to engage in writing exercises meant to expand the conception of what a poem is and can be. As the course progresses, reading assignments will be tailored on an individual basis, and an increasing amount of time will be spent in discussion of student work."
Advanced Fiction,ENGLISH CFE,FAS,English,"The course will consist of two halves. In the first hour of each class, we will be doing close readings/literary-critical analyses of an assigned text (see below, ‘Course Schedule’, for all the reading material for the semester), with the aim of isolating some aspect of the craft of writing in order to take bearings for your own. We will be looking at technical things such as point of view, free indirect discourse, narration, character, interiority, style, movement, affect, but also at broader i"
Advanced Poetry: Workshop,ENGLISH CHCR,FAS,English,"By guided reading, classroom discussion, one on one conference, and formal and structural experimentation, members of the Advanced Poetry Workshop will look to hone, deepen, and challenge the development of their poetic inquiry and aesthetic. Students will be required to write and submit one new poem each week and to perform in-depth, weekly critiques of their colleagues' work."
Getting the Words Right: The Art of Revision,ENGLISH CLAR,FAS,English,"A promising draft is of little use to us as writers if we have no idea what to do next, of how to begin again. This course aims to illuminate how revision can be every bit as creative and exhilarating as getting the first draft down—and how time spent re-imagining our early drafts is the ultimate show of faith in our work. We will explore the art of revision—of realizing the promise of that first draft—through reading, craft discussion, exercises, and workshop. Students can exp"
Play and Games: The Art of Sportswriting,ENGLISH CLPG,FAS,English,"In newsrooms, the sports section is sometimes referred to as the “toy department” -- frivolous and unserious, unlike the stuff of politics, business, and war. In this course, we will take the toys seriously. After all, for millions of people, sports and other so-called trivial pursuits (video games, chess, board games, and so on) are a source of endless fascination. For us, they will be a source of stories about human achievements and frustrations. These stories can involve economic,"
Introduction to Screenwriting: Workshop,ENGLISH CLR,FAS,English,"The short film, with its relatively lower costs of production and expanded distribution opportunities, has become one of the most disruptive, innovative modes of storytelling--and is often an emerging filmmaker's first step into a career.

In the first quarter of the semester, we will hone dramatic techniques through several craft exercise"
Past Selves and Future Ghosts,ENGLISH CMFG,FAS,English,"As memoirist and author Melissa Febos puts it: “The narrator is never you, and the sooner we can start thinking of ourselves on the page that way, the better for our work. That character on the page is just this shaving off of the person that was within a very particular context, intermingled with bits of perspective from all the time since — it’s a very specific little cocktail of pieces of the self and memory and art … it’s a very weird thing. And then it’s"
Creative Nonfiction Workshop: Using Music,ENGLISH CMMU,FAS,English,"In this workshop-based class, students will think deeply about how music is often at the center of their experiences, may it be as a song, an album, an artist, their own relationship with an instrument, etc. This class will entail writing true stories about one's life in which the personal and music orbit and/or entangle each other. This will include some journalism and criticism, but above all it will ask you to describe how and why music matters to your lived life. We will read work by Hay"
Narrative Journalism,ENGLISH CNFJ,FAS,English,"In this hands-on writing workshop, we will study the art of narrative journalism in many different forms: Profile writing, investigative reportage, magazine features. How can a work of journalism be fashioned to tell a captivating story? How can the writer of nonfiction narratives employ the scene-by-scene construction usually found in fiction? How can facts become the building blocks of literature? Students will work on several short assignments to practice the nuts-and-bolts of reporting, then"
Creative Nonfiction: Workshop,ENGLISH CNFR,FAS,English,"Whether it takes the form of literary journalism, essay, memoir, or environmental writing, creative nonfiction is a powerful genre that allows writers to break free from the constraints commonly associated with nonfiction prose and reach for the breadth of thought and feeling usually accomplished only in fiction: the narration of a vivid story, the probing of a complex character, the argument of an idea, or the evocation of a place. Students will work on several short assignments to hone their m"
The Novel Workshop,ENGLISH CNW,FAS,English,"In this workshop, we will study the art and craft of writing novels. We’ll consider published work in order to get a better sense of the multiple choices writers can make when they shape a book-length narrative. Our objectives will be the following: (1) to prepare you for writing a novel, (2) to deepen your reading of other writers’ work,  (3) to workshop the opening chapter(s) of your novel, (4) to help you create a working outline for the kind of book you want to write. While some worksho"
Specialized Topics in Playwriting: Object Memory,ENGLISH CPOM,FAS,English,"Being a theater artist often involves moving in several directions in time simultaneously. We think about our past, our lives, our work, our moment, our vision. How do we find inspiration? How do we make work? How do our creations for the stage live in relation to ‘the rest of our lives’. Our use of objects and our memory of those objects can help respond to these questions in writing and acting. This class will seek to have students examine object memory in writing. Students will do writing exe"
“Telling and Retelling”: Reshaping and Remixing Myths and Fairy Tales,ENGLISH CTLL,FAS,English,"This is a fiction workshop for those who are interested in retellings. In this class, we will learn how other writers of the 20th and 21st centuries have taken fairy tales, epic poetry, problematic horror, and Chekov’s short fiction, and retooled them for their own purposes. You will also practice the art of retelling in two ways: first, you will write your own flash piece inspired by some fairy tale of your choosing, and second, you will select another “story” (I use this term broadly – yo"
Literary Forms,ENGLISH 20,FAS,English,"This foundational course for English concentrators examines literary form and genre. We explore some of the many kinds of literature as they have changed over time, along with the shapes and forms that writers create, critics describe, and readers learn to recognize. The body of the course looks to the great literary types, or modes, such as epic, tragedy, and lyric, as well as to the workings of literary style in moments of historical change, producing the transformation, recycling, and sometim"
"Indigenous Sci Fi, Horror, Fantasy, and Futurisms",ENGLISH 90FF,FAS,English,"This course will examine contemporary writings by Native American and Indigenous authors across the genres of sci fi, horror, and fantasy, with the aim of thinking about Native American and Indigenous futures (and futurisms) more broadly, and also in ways that may exceed genre altogether. In other words, our investigation will be organized according to conventional sci fi genres of slipstream, alien contact, and apocalypse, but also to non-genre expressions of Indigenous futurity. By juxtaposing"

Harvard and Native Lands,ENGLISH 90LN,FAS,English,"Harvard’s beginnings included a promise to educate both “English and Indian youth.” From its inception, however, Harvard’s endowment included Native lands expropriated through war, theft, and coercion. Drawing inspiration from Harvard’s own Legacy of Slavery initiative and the Land-Grab Universities website, this class will conduct original research on Harvard’s long history of involvement with Native communities and Native lands. We w"
Before the Novel: Medieval Romance,ENGLISH 90MC,FAS,English,"This course would read a wide selection of romances, one of the great narrative forms of the middle ages. We'd look at specific romance elements, including the quest; at the structure of romances or what Jameson calls their ""ecology,"" the experimental spaces they open and eventually close; at the gendering of persons within romances; and other topics. Texts TBD but would include one or two Marie de France Lais (short romances); at least one Arthur story, potentially Malory's Morte d'Arthure (sel"
"Superheroes: Stories, Characters, Comics, Art and Society",ENGLISH 90SU,FAS,English,"What's a superhero and why do people care? Where do they come from, what do they do, and why would anyone ever choose to be one? We will follow those questions through DC and Marvel continuity, with attention to super-famous figures, national myths, and  groups of young people and outcasts: Superman, Supergirl, the X-Men, Captain America (and Bucky), Wakanda. We will think about sexuality, and (respectfully!) about the military. We will look at comics as an art form and as a visual medium."
Tolkien's Library,ENGLISH 90TK,FAS,English,"J. R. R. Tolkien's day job at Oxford was professor of medieval English literature. Throughout his career he cultivated a deep acquaintance with early English and other literatures from the cultures of northwestern Europe, which informed the fantasy worlds he created. We will read broad selections from translations of works that he drew from: Old English poems, Norse sagas, Celtic literature, and the Finnish Kalevala. Although Tolkien’s fiction will not be an integral part of the syllab"

Sophomore Tutorial: Literary Methods,ENGLISH 97,FAS,English,"This course, taught in small groups and required for concentrators, introduces theories, interpretive frameworks, and central questions about literature and literary media. What do we do when we read? What is an author? What do we mean by “literature” itself? How might we compare and evaluate interpretations?

Epic: From Homer to Star Wars,ENGLISH 111,FAS,English,"Epic is one of the most enduring and far-reaching forms of artistic expression. From the heroic poems of the ancient Near East to modern films of quest and adventure, epic speaks to the shared values and collective aspirations of cultures, peoples, and communities. But if its formal conventions and thematic interests endure, epic changes over time. In this course, you will study the historical and literary evolution of epic as it moves from oral verse into new genres and media, reading text"
Keats Isn't Dead: How We Live Romanticism,ENGLISH 152KD,FAS,English,"Our thoughts and feelings about identity, self-expression, and the power of the imagination draw on the British Romantic poetry of the Long Eighteenth Century—whether we've read any or not. Focusing on John Keats (his key poems, and his key ideas, about ""negative capability"", the ""camelion poet"", and so on), this course makes unconventional connections into the twentieth, and twenty-first century. Tracking issues of race, class, gender and sexuality, we'll bounc"
William Butler Yeats and the Modern World,ENGLISH 169Y,FAS,English,"One of the great creators in his, or any, era. W. B. Yeats (1865-1939) left us a matchless body of lyric and dramatic verse, including love poems, political meditations, ballads, prophetic warnings, palinodes, and rewritten myths. He also wrote and co-wrote transcribed folktales, novels, literary criticism, memoir, political speeches, records of mystical visions, and tens of thousands of letters; promoted Irish culture; ran a theatre company; won a Nobel prize; stood against empire and theocracy"
The Black Lyric,ENGLISH 173BL,FAS,English,"African American poets have long embraced the private freedoms of the lyric poem—freedom to claim the authority of an uncontested first person “I”; freedom to wrangle language into new and startling forms; freedom to depart as needed from the strictures of linear reality. And yet, from its earliest iterations, African American poetry has also concerned itself with correcting and complicating the official narrative of Black life and Black subjectivity in America. This course wil"
The Essay: History and Practice,ENGLISH 185E,FAS,English,"Matthew Arnold famously said that poetry is, at bottom, “a criticism of life.” But if any literary form is truly a criticism of life, it is the essay. And yet despite the fact that all students write essays, most students rarely study them; bookshops and libraries categorize such work only negatively, by what it is not: “non-fiction.” At the same time, the essay is at present one of the most productive and fertile of literary forms. It is practiced as memoir, reportage, d"
Adaptation: The Art of Retelling,ENGLISH 199AD,FAS,English,"What makes a good adaptation? Why retell an old story? This class explores texts that are in conversation with others: adaptation, translation, fanfiction, parody, pastiche, and the remix. We will think about the role of form, genre, and media in adaptation, the decisions involved in transposing a story from novel to screen or stage, from oral storytelling to the printed page to digital archive, across times, contexts, languages, and audiences. Texts/movies discussed include fairytales, The Grea"
Beowulf and Seamus Heaney,ENGLISH 202B,FAS,English,"This course balances translation, poetics, and literary criticism. The commercial success of Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf has given it a prominence in the general reading public the poem has rarely if ever enjoyed. At the same time its popularization at the hands of a self-described “interloper” has created a certain amount of anxiety among scholars of Old English. Our weekly discussions will include issues of translation while we compare our in-class efforts with Heaney's and with oth"
Uncommon Tongue: Lucille Clifton and her Literary Kin,ENGLISH 273CL,FAS,English,"Across her body of work, great American poet Lucille Clifton celebrates, defends and bears witness to the complexities and the revelations of Black life. Committed to the trends and crises of her own time period, Clifton also draws consistently and inventively upon various strands of history and myth; the result is a body of work alive with ever-urgent relevance to the 21st Century’s crises of white supremacy, political disenfranchisement and planetary disaster.  In this seminar, we will ex"
Book Theory,ENGLISH 293B,FAS,English,"In this seminar we will work our way through theoretical work presenting the Western book as, variously, medium, interface, commodity, technology (including technology of empire), storage device, and “scriptive thing” --both classic theories (e.g., Jacques Derrida, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Curtius, Gérard Genette, Roger Chartier) and more recent ones (e.g., Mark McGurl, Jessica Pressman, Leah Price, Nicholas Thorburn, Kelly Wisecup, Robin Bernstein, Tia Blassingame).

Wild Criticism,ENGLISH 299WC,FAS,English,"Beginning with Oscar Wilde, who suggested in 1891 that “the primary aim of the critic is to see the object as in itself it really is not,” this course shows today’s debates over “creative criticism” and “postcriticism” to have a long history. We’ll consider, in particular, writers who quote other writers at length—close reading them—but in nonplussing, counterintuitive, even shocking ways. Monica Youn and William Empson, for instance, read John Milton against the grain; Pierre Bayard returns to"

Getting the Words Right: The Art of Revision,ENGLISH CLAR,FAS,English,"A promising draft is of little use to us as writers if we have no idea what to do next, of how to begin again. This course aims to illuminate how revision can be every bit as creative and exhilarating as getting the first draft down—and how time spent re-imagining our early drafts is the ultimate show of faith in our work. We will explore the art of revision—of realizing the promise of that first draft—through reading, craft discussion, exercises, and workshop. Students can exp"
Play and Games: The Art of Sportswriting,ENGLISH CLPG,FAS,English,"In newsrooms, the sports section is sometimes referred to as the “toy department” -- frivolous and unserious, unlike the stuff of politics, business, and war. In this course, we will take the toys seriously. After all, for millions of people, sports and other so-called trivial pursuits (video games, chess, board games, and so on) are a source of endless fascination. For us, they will be a source of stories about human achievements and frustrations. These stories can involve economic,"
Introduction to Screenwriting: Workshop,ENGLISH CLR,FAS,English,"The short film, with its relatively lower costs of production and expanded distribution opportunities, has become one of the most disruptive, innovative modes of storytelling--and is often an emerging filmmaker's first step into a career.

In the first quarter of the semester, we will hone dramatic techniques through several craft exercise"
Past Selves and Future Ghosts,ENGLISH CMFG,FAS,English,"As memoirist and author Melissa Febos puts it: “The narrator is never you, and the sooner we can start thinking of ourselves on the page that way, the better for our work. That character on the page is just this shaving off of the person that was within a very particular context, intermingled with bits of perspective from all the time since — it’s a very specific little cocktail of pieces of the self and memory and art … it’s a very weird thing. And then it’s"
Creative Nonfiction Workshop: Using Music,ENGLISH CMMU,FAS,English,"In this workshop-based class, students will think deeply about how music is often at the center of their experiences, may it be as a song, an album, an artist, their own relationship with an instrument, etc. This class will entail writing true stories about one's life in which the personal and music orbit and/or entangle each other. This will include some journalism and criticism, but above all it will ask you to describe how and why music matters to your lived life. We will read work by Hay"
Narrative Journalism,ENGLISH CNFJ,FAS,English,"In this hands-on writing workshop, we will study the art of narrative journalism in many different forms: Profile writing, investigative reportage, magazine features. How can a work of journalism be fashioned to tell a captivating story? How can the writer of nonfiction narratives employ the scene-by-scene construction usually found in fiction? How can facts become the building blocks of literature? Students will work on several short assignments to practice the nuts-and-bolts of reporting, then"
Creative Nonfiction: Workshop,ENGLISH CNFR,FAS,English,"Whether it takes the form of literary journalism, essay, memoir, or environmental writing, creative nonfiction is a powerful genre that allows writers to break free from the constraints commonly associated with nonfiction prose and reach for the breadth of thought and feeling usually accomplished only in fiction: the narration of a vivid story, the probing of a complex character, the argument of an idea, or the evocation of a place. Students will work on several short assignments to hone their m"
The Novel Workshop,ENGLISH CNW,FAS,English,"In this workshop, we will study the art and craft of writing novels. We’ll consider published work in order to get a better sense of the multiple choices writers can make when they shape a book-length narrative. Our objectives will be the following: (1) to prepare you for writing a novel, (2) to deepen your reading of other writers’ work,  (3) to workshop the opening chapter(s) of your novel, (4) to help you create a working outline for the kind of book you want to write. While some worksho"
Specialized Topics in Playwriting: Object Memory,ENGLISH CPOM,FAS,English,"Being a theater artist often involves moving in several directions in time simultaneously. We think about our past, our lives, our work, our moment, our vision. How do we find inspiration? How do we make work? How do our creations for the stage live in relation to ‘the rest of our lives’. Our use of objects and our memory of those objects can help respond to these questions in writing and acting. This class will seek to have students examine object memory in writing. Students will do writing exe"
“Telling and Retelling”: Reshaping and Remixing Myths and Fairy Tales,ENGLISH CTLL,FAS,English,"This is a fiction workshop for those who are interested in retellings. In this class, we will learn how other writers of the 20th and 21st centuries have taken fairy tales, epic poetry, problematic horror, and Chekov’s short fiction, and retooled them for their own purposes. You will also practice the art of retelling in two ways: first, you will write your own flash piece inspired by some fairy tale of your choosing, and second, you will select another “story” (I use this term broadly – yo"
Literary Forms,ENGLISH 20,FAS,English,"This foundational course for English concentrators examines literary form and genre. We explore some of the many kinds of literature as they have changed over time, along with the shapes and forms that writers create, critics describe, and readers learn to recognize. The body of the course looks to the great literary types, or modes, such as epic, tragedy, and lyric, as well as to the workings of literary style in moments of historical change, producing the transformation, recycling, and sometim"
"Indigenous Sci Fi, Horror, Fantasy, and Futurisms",ENGLISH 90FF,FAS,English,"This course will examine contemporary writings by Native American and Indigenous authors across the genres of sci fi, horror, and fantasy, with the aim of thinking about Native American and Indigenous futures (and futurisms) more broadly, and also in ways that may exceed genre altogether. In other words, our investigation will be organized according to conventional sci fi genres of slipstream, alien contact, and apocalypse, but also to non-genre expressions of Indigenous futurity. By juxtaposing"

We w"
Before the Novel: Medieval Romance,ENGLISH 90MC,FAS,English,"This course would read a wide selection of romances, one of the great narrative forms of the middle ages. We'd look at specific romance elements, including the quest; at the structure of romances or what Jameson calls their ""ecology,"" the experimental spaces they open and eventually close; at the gendering of persons within romances; and other topics. Texts TBD but would include one or two Marie de France Lais (short romances); at least one Arthur story, potentially Malory's Morte d'Arthure (sel"
"Superheroes: Stories, Characters, Comics, Art and Society",ENGLISH 90SU,FAS,English,"What's a superhero and why do people care? Where do they come from, what do they do, and why would anyone ever choose to be one? We will follow those questions through DC and Marvel continuity, with attention to super-famous figures, national myths, and  groups of young people and outcasts: Superman, Supergirl, the X-Men, Captain America (and Bucky), Wakanda. We will think about sexuality, and (respectfully!) about the military. We will look at comics as an art form and as a visual medium."
Tolkien's Library,ENGLISH 90TK,FAS,English,"J. R. R. Tolkien's day job at Oxford was professor of medieval English literature. Throughout his career he cultivated a deep acquaintance with early English and other literatures from the cultures of northwestern Europe, which informed the fantasy worlds he created. We will read broad selections from translations of works that he drew from: Old English poems, Norse sagas, Celtic literature, and the Finnish Kalevala.

Epic: From Homer to Star Wars,ENGLISH 111,FAS,English,"Epic is one of the most enduring and far-reaching forms of artistic expression. From the heroic poems of the ancient Near East to modern films of quest and adventure, epic speaks to the shared values and collective aspirations of cultures, peoples, and communities. But if its formal conventions and thematic interests endure, epic changes over time. In this course, you will study the historical and literary evolution of epic as it moves from oral verse into new genres and media, reading text"
Keats Isn't Dead: How We Live Romanticism,ENGLISH 152KD,FAS,English,"Our thoughts and feelings about identity, self-expression, and the power of the imagination draw on the British Romantic poetry of the Long Eighteenth Century—whether we've read any or not. Focusing on John Keats (his key poems, and his key ideas, about ""negative capability"", the ""camelion poet"", and so on), this course makes unconventional connections into the twentieth, and twenty-first century. Tracking issues of race, class, gender and sexuality, we'll bounc"
William Butler Yeats and the Modern World,ENGLISH 169Y,FAS,English,"One of the great creators in his, or any, era. W. B. Yeats (1865-1939) left us a matchless body of lyric and dramatic verse, including love poems, political meditations, ballads, prophetic warnings, palinodes, and rewritten myths. He also wrote and co-wrote transcribed folktales, novels, literary criticism, memoir, political speeches, records of mystical visions, and tens of thousands of letters; promoted Irish culture; ran a theatre company; won a Nobel prize; stood against empire and theocracy"
The Black Lyric,ENGLISH 173BL,FAS,English,"African American poets have long embraced the private freedoms of the lyric poem—freedom to claim the authority of an uncontested first person “I”; freedom to wrangle language into new and startling forms; freedom to depart as needed from the strictures of linear reality. And yet, from its earliest iterations, African American poetry has also concerned itself with correcting and complicating the official narrative of Black life and Black subjectivity in America. This course wil"
The Essay: History and Practice,ENGLISH 185E,FAS,English,"Matthew Arnold famously said that poetry is, at bottom, “a criticism of life.” But if any literary form is truly a criticism of life, it is the essay. And yet despite the fact that all students write essays, most students rarely study them; bookshops and libraries categorize such work only negatively, by what it is not: “non-fiction.” At the same time, the essay is at present one of the most productive and fertile of literary forms. It is practiced as memoir, reportage, d"
Adaptation: The Art of Retelling,ENGLISH 199AD,FAS,English,"What makes a good adaptation? Why retell an old story? This class explores texts that are in conversation with others: adaptation, translation, fanfiction, parody, pastiche, and the remix. We will think about the role of form, genre, and media in adaptation, the decisions involved in transposing a story from novel to screen or stage, from oral storytelling to the printed page to digital archive, across times, contexts, languages, and audiences. Texts/movies discussed include fairytales, The Grea"
Beowulf and Seamus Heaney,ENGLISH 202B,FAS,English,"This course balances translation, poetics, and literary criticism. The commercial success of Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf has given it a prominence in the general reading public the poem has rarely if ever enjoyed. At the same time its popularization at the hands of a self-described “interloper” has created a certain amount of anxiety among scholars of Old English. Our weekly discussions will include issues of translation while we compare our in-class efforts with Heaney's and with oth"
Uncommon Tongue: Lucille Clifton and her Literary Kin,ENGLISH 273CL,FAS,English,"Across her body of work, great American poet Lucille Clifton celebrates, defends and bears witness to the complexities and the revelations of Black life. Committed to the trends and crises of her own time period, Clifton also draws consistently and inventively upon various strands of history and myth; the result is a body of work alive with ever-urgent relevance to the 21st Century’s crises of white supremacy, political disenfranchisement and planetary disaster.  In this seminar, we will ex"
Book Theory,ENGLISH 293B,FAS,English,"In this seminar we will work our way through theoretical work presenting the Western book as, variously, medium, interface, commodity, technology (including technology of empire), storage device, and “scriptive thing” --both classic theories (e.g., Jacques Derrida, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Curtius, Gérard Genette, Roger Chartier) and more recent ones (e.g., Mark McGurl, Jessica Pressman, Leah Price, Nicholas Thorburn, Kelly Wisecup, Robin Bernstein, Tia Blassingame).

Wild Criticism,ENGLISH 299WC,FAS,English,"Beginning with Oscar Wilde, who suggested in 1891 that “the primary aim of the critic is to see the object as in itself it really is not,” this course shows today’s debates over “creative criticism” and “postcriticism” to have a long history. We’ll consider, in particular, writers who quote other writers at length—close reading them—but in nonplussing, counterintuitive, even shocking ways. Monica Youn and William Empson, for instance, read John Milton against the grain; Pierre Bayard returns to"

As the course progresses, reading assignments will be tailored on an individual basis, and an increasing amount of time will be spent in discussion of student work."
Advanced Fiction,ENGLISH CFE,FAS,English,"The course will consist of two halves. In the first hour of each class, we will be doing close readings/literary-critical analyses of an assigned text (see below, ‘Course Schedule’, for all the reading material for the semester), with the aim of isolating some aspect of the craft of writing in order to take bearings for your own. We will be looking at technical things such as point of view, free indirect discourse, narration, character, interiority, style, movement, affect, but also at broader i"
Advanced Poetry: Workshop,ENGLISH CHCR,FAS,English,"By guided reading, classroom discussion, one on one conference, and formal and structural experimentation, members of the Advanced Poetry Workshop will look to hone, deepen, and challenge the development of their poetic inquiry and aesthetic. Students will be required to write and submit one new poem each week and to perform in-depth, weekly critiques of their colleagues' work."
Getting the Words Right: The Art of Revision,ENGLISH CLAR,FAS,English,"A promising draft is of little use to us as writers if we have no idea what to do next, of how to begin again. This course aims to illuminate how revision can be every bit as creative and exhilarating as getting the first draft down—and how time spent re-imagining our early drafts is the ultimate show of faith in our work. We will explore the art of revision—of realizing the promise of that first draft—through reading, craft discussion, exercises, and workshop. Students can exp"
Play and Games: The Art of Sportswriting,ENGLISH CLPG,FAS,English,"In newsrooms, the sports section is sometimes referred to as the “toy department” -- frivolous and unserious, unlike the stuff of politics, business, and war. In this course, we will take the toys seriously. After all, for millions of people, sports and other so-called trivial pursuits (video games, chess, board games, and so on) are a source of endless fascination. For us, they will be a source of stories about human achievements and frustrations. These stories can involve economic,"
Introduction to Screenwriting: Workshop,ENGLISH CLR,FAS,English,"The short film, with its relatively lower costs of production and expanded distribution opportunities, has become one of the most disruptive, innovative modes of storytelling--and is often an emerging filmmaker's first step into a career. This course will introduce students to the basics of short form screenwriting, including narrative theory/structure, character design, and dialogue/voice. In the first quarter of the semester, we will hone dramatic techniques through several craft exercise"
Past Selves and Future Ghosts,ENGLISH CMFG,FAS,English,"As memoirist and author Melissa Febos puts it: “The narrator is never you, and the sooner we can start thinking of ourselves on the page that way, the better for our work. That character on the page is just this shaving off of the person that was within a very particular context, intermingled with bits of perspective from all the time since — it’s a very specific little cocktail of pieces of the self and memory and art … it’s a very weird thing. And then it’s"
Creative Nonfiction Workshop: Using Music,ENGLISH CMMU,FAS,English,"In this workshop-based class, students will think deeply about how music is often at the center of their experiences, may it be as a song, an album, an artist, their own relationship with an instrument, etc. This class will entail writing true stories about one's life in which the personal and music orbit and/or entangle each other. This will include some journalism and criticism, but above all it will ask you to describe how and why music matters to your lived life. We will read work by Hay"
Narrative Journalism,ENGLISH CNFJ,FAS,English,"In this hands-on writing workshop, we will study the art of narrative journalism in many different forms: Profile writing, investigative reportage, magazine features. How can a work of journalism be fashioned to tell a captivating story? How can the writer of nonfiction narratives employ the scene-by-scene construction usually found in fiction? How can facts become the building blocks of literature? Students will work on several short assignments to practice the nuts-and-bolts of reporting, then"
Creative Nonfiction: Workshop,ENGLISH CNFR,FAS,English,"Whether it takes the form of literary journalism, essay, memoir, or environmental writing, creative nonfiction is a powerful genre that allows writers to break free from the constraints commonly associated with nonfiction prose and reach for the breadth of thought and feeling usually accomplished only in fiction: the narration of a vivid story, the probing of a complex character, the argument of an idea, or the evocation of a place. Students will work on several short assignments to hone their m"
The Novel Workshop,ENGLISH CNW,FAS,English,"In this workshop, we will study the art and craft of writing novels. We’ll consider published work in order to get a better sense of the multiple choices writers can make when they shape a book-length narrative. Our objectives will be the following: (1) to prepare you for writing a novel, (2) to deepen your reading of other writers’ work,  (3) to workshop the opening chapter(s) of your novel, (4) to help you create a working outline for the kind of book you want to write. While some worksho"
Specialized Topics in Playwriting: Object Memory,ENGLISH CPOM,FAS,English,"Being a theater artist often involves moving in several directions in time simultaneously. We think about our past, our lives, our work, our moment, our vision. How do we find inspiration? How do we make work? How do our creations for the stage live in relation to ‘the rest of our lives’. Our use of objects and our memory of those objects can help respond to these questions in writing and acting. This class will seek to have students examine object memory in writing. Students will do writing exe"
“Telling and Retelling”: Reshaping and Remixing Myths and Fairy Tales,ENGLISH CTLL,FAS,English,"This is a fiction workshop for those who are interested in retellings. In this class, we will learn how other writers of the 20th and 21st centuries have taken fairy tales, epic poetry, problematic horror, and Chekov’s short fiction, and retooled them for their own purposes. You will also practice the art of retelling in two ways: first, you will write your own flash piece inspired by some fairy tale of your choosing, and second, you will select another “story” (I use this term broadly – yo"
Literary Forms,ENGLISH 20,FAS,English,"This foundational course for English concentrators examines literary form and genre. We explore some of the many kinds of literature as they have changed over time, along with the shapes and forms that writers create, critics describe, and readers learn to recognize. The body of the course looks to the great literary types, or modes, such as epic, tragedy, and lyric, as well as to the workings of literary style in moments of historical change, producing the transformation, recycling, and sometim"
"Indigenous Sci Fi, Horror, Fantasy, and Futurisms",ENGLISH 90FF,FAS,English,"This course will examine contemporary writings by Native American and Indigenous authors across the genres of sci fi, horror, and fantasy, with the aim of thinking about Native American and Indigenous futures (and futurisms) more broadly, and also in ways that may exceed genre altogether. In other words, our investigation will be organized according to conventional sci fi genres of slipstream, alien contact, and apocalypse, but also to non-genre expressions of Indigenous futurity. By juxtaposing"

Harvard and Native Lands,ENGLISH 90LN,FAS,English,"Harvard’s beginnings included a promise to educate both “English and Indian youth.” From its inception, however, Harvard’s endowment included Native lands expropriated through war, theft, and coercion. Drawing inspiration from Harvard’s own Legacy of Slavery initiative and the Land-Grab Universities website, this class will conduct original research on Harvard’s long history of involvement with Native communities and Native lands. We w"
Before the Novel: Medieval Romance,ENGLISH 90MC,FAS,English,"This course would read a wide selection of romances, one of the great narrative forms of the middle ages. We'd look at specific romance elements, including the quest; at the structure of romances or what Jameson calls their ""ecology,"" the experimental spaces they open and eventually close; at the gendering of persons within romances; and other topics. Texts TBD but would include one or two Marie de France Lais (short romances); at least one Arthur story, potentially Malory's Morte d'Arthure (sel"
"Superheroes: Stories, Characters, Comics, Art and Society",ENGLISH 90SU,FAS,English,"What's a superhero and why do people care? Where do they come from, what do they do, and why would anyone ever choose to be one? We will follow those questions through DC and Marvel continuity, with attention to super-famous figures, national myths, and  groups of young people and outcasts: Superman, Supergirl, the X-Men, Captain America (and Bucky), Wakanda. We will think about sexuality, and (respectfully!) about the military. We will look at comics as an art form and as a visual medium."
Tolkien's Library,ENGLISH 90TK,FAS,English,"J. R. R. Tolkien's day job at Oxford was professor of medieval English literature. Throughout his career he cultivated a deep acquaintance with early English and other literatures from the cultures of northwestern Europe, which informed the fantasy worlds he created. We will read broad selections from translations of works that he drew from: Old English poems, Norse sagas, Celtic literature, and the Finnish Kalevala. Although Tolkien’s fiction will not be an integral part of the syllab"

Sophomore Tutorial: Literary Methods,ENGLISH 97,FAS,English,"This course, taught in small groups and required for concentrators, introduces theories, interpretive frameworks, and central questions about literature and literary media. What do we do when we read? What is an author? What do we mean by “literature” itself? How might we compare and evaluate interpretations? How do the historical, social, cultural, and legal frameworks around a text shape its meanings and its effects? Combining major critical and theoretical writings with primary wo"

Epic: From Homer to Star Wars,ENGLISH 111,FAS,English,"Epic is one of the most enduring and far-reaching forms of artistic expression. From the heroic poems of the ancient Near East to modern films of quest and adventure, epic speaks to the shared values and collective aspirations of cultures, peoples, and communities. But if its formal conventions and thematic interests endure, epic changes over time. In this course, you will study the historical and literary evolution of epic as it moves from oral verse into new genres and media, reading text"
Keats Isn't Dead: How We Live Romanticism,ENGLISH 152KD,FAS,English,"Our thoughts and feelings about identity, self-expression, and the power of the imagination draw on the British Romantic poetry of the Long Eighteenth Century—whether we've read any or not. Focusing on John Keats (his key poems, and his key ideas, about ""negative capability"", the ""camelion poet"", and so on), this course makes unconventional connections into the twentieth, and twenty-first century. Tracking issues of race, class, gender and sexuality, we'll bounc"
William Butler Yeats and the Modern World,ENGLISH 169Y,FAS,English,"One of the great creators in his, or any, era. W. B. Yeats (1865-1939) left us a matchless body of lyric and dramatic verse, including love poems, political meditations, ballads, prophetic warnings, palinodes, and rewritten myths. He also wrote and co-wrote transcribed folktales, novels, literary criticism, memoir, political speeches, records of mystical visions, and tens of thousands of letters; promoted Irish culture; ran a theatre company; won a Nobel prize; stood against empire and theocracy"
The Black Lyric,ENGLISH 173BL,FAS,English,"African American poets have long embraced the private freedoms of the lyric poem—freedom to claim the authority of an uncontested first person “I”; freedom to wrangle language into new and startling forms; freedom to depart as needed from the strictures of linear reality. And yet, from its earliest iterations, African American poetry has also concerned itself with correcting and complicating the official narrative of Black life and Black subjectivity in America. This course wil"
The Essay: History and Practice,ENGLISH 185E,FAS,English,"Matthew Arnold famously said that poetry is, at bottom, “a criticism of life.” But if any literary form is truly a criticism of life, it is the essay. And yet despite the fact that all students write essays, most students rarely study them; bookshops and libraries categorize such work only negatively, by what it is not: “non-fiction.” At the same time, the essay is at present one of the most productive and fertile of literary forms. It is practiced as memoir, reportage, d"
Adaptation: The Art of Retelling,ENGLISH 199AD,FAS,English,"What makes a good adaptation? Why retell an old story? This class explores texts that are in conversation with others: adaptation, translation, fanfiction, parody, pastiche, and the remix. We will think about the role of form, genre, and media in adaptation, the decisions involved in transposing a story from novel to screen or stage, from oral storytelling to the printed page to digital archive, across times, contexts, languages, and audiences. Texts/movies discussed include fairytales, The Grea"
Beowulf and Seamus Heaney,ENGLISH 202B,FAS,English,"This course balances translation, poetics, and literary criticism. The commercial success of Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf has given it a prominence in the general reading public the poem has rarely if ever enjoyed. At the same time its popularization at the hands of a self-described “interloper” has created a certain amount of anxiety among scholars of Old English. Our weekly discussions will include issues of translation while we compare our in-class efforts with Heaney's and with oth"
Uncommon Tongue: Lucille Clifton and her Literary Kin,ENGLISH 273CL,FAS,English,"Across her body of work, great American poet Lucille Clifton celebrates, defends and bears witness to the complexities and the revelations of Black life. Committed to the trends and crises of her own time period, Clifton also draws consistently and inventively upon various strands of history and myth; the result is a body of work alive with ever-urgent relevance to the 21st Century’s crises of white supremacy, political disenfranchisement and planetary disaster.  In this seminar, we will ex"
Book Theory,ENGLISH 293B,FAS,English,"In this seminar we will work our way through theoretical work presenting the Western book as, variously, medium, interface, commodity, technology (including technology of empire), storage device, and “scriptive thing” --both classic theories (e.g., Jacques Derrida, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Curtius, Gérard Genette, Roger Chartier) and more recent ones (e.g., Mark McGurl, Jessica Pressman, Leah Price, Nicholas Thorburn, Kelly Wisecup, Robin Bernstein, Tia Blassingame).

Wild Criticism,ENGLISH 299WC,FAS,English,"Beginning with Oscar Wilde, who suggested in 1891 that “the primary aim of the critic is to see the object as in itself it really is not,” this course shows today’s debates over “creative criticism” and “postcriticism” to have a long history. We’ll consider, in particular, writers who quote other writers at length—close reading them—but in nonplussing, counterintuitive, even shocking ways. Monica Youn and William Empson, for instance, read John Milton against the grain; Pierre Bayard returns to"

Death: Its Nature and Significance,FYSEMR 60S,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Here's a hard truth: You are going to die. That's nothing against you, of course. I'm going to die, too, and so is everyone else ‐ it's just the way of things for creatures like us. Yet, despite the central role that death plays in our existence, it seems to remain deeply mysterious in a number of ways. It is difficult even to say precisely what death is—is it a mere biological phenomenon? If so, is there any sense to be made of the idea that I might continue to exist after my death, perhaps as"
Can Art Inspire Justice?,FYSEMR 62M,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"How do images—photographs, films, videos—create narratives that shape our definition of national belonging? Social media has changed how we ingest images.

"Fun With Writing… or, Writing for Weirdos",FYSEMR 64Q,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Writing can be fun. Writing can be weird. By “writing”, we don’t only mean the act of putting pen to paper, or fingers to computer keys to type. Writing is the conscious act of choosing words or texts or images and composing them in such a way to create an intended effect. Yes, writing is a deliberate and emotional process… but not one which has to be necessarily painstaking. What if, first and foremost, writing was fun? This is the question we’ll explore and enact"

Death: Its Nature and Significance,FYSEMR 60S,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"Here's a hard truth: You are going to die. That's nothing against you, of course. I'm going to die, too, and so is everyone else ‐ it's just the way of things for creatures like us. Yet, despite the central role that death plays in our existence, it seems to remain deeply mysterious in a number of ways. It is difficult even to say precisely what death is—is it a mere biological phenomenon? If so, is there any sense to be made of the idea that I might continue to exist after my death, perhaps as"
Can Art Inspire Justice?,FYSEMR 62M,FAS,First Year Seminar Program,"How do images—photographs, films, videos—create narratives that shape our definition of national belonging?

By “writing”, we don’t only mean the act of putting pen to paper, or fingers to computer keys to type. Writing is the conscious act of choosing words or texts or images and composing them in such a way to create an intended effect.
