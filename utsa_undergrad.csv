The PLC serves as a touchstone in the secondary teacher certification program, bringing together preclinical and clinical teacher candidates within disciplinary areas to share and co-construct knowledge and skills applied to their field-based classroom experiences. By working in small groups of colleagues and peers, learning is emergent, responsive, and collaborative. Although the PLC is facilitated by faculty members with expertise in the specialty area, it is a vehicle for horizontal expertise where students and faculty alike share their expertise and insights. In this way, the PLC is a community of practice where teacher candidates come together to (a) share learning from various school- and community-based experiences and (b) synthesize learning through reflection and discussion on teaching and being a teacher. Multiple discipline-based sections will be offered each semester, and all preclinical and clinical teachers in a discipline will enroll in the same section throughout their program. Teacher candidates must pass the course with a CR to qualify for clinical teaching. This course will not be offered in the Summer.
