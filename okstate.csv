Over the course of the semester, we will examine the visual culture of social dance in order to gain insight into its historical functions as a tool for social cohesion, intercultural exchange, protest/activism, and identity formation, among other things. Through the practice of these dance forms, we will add an experiential component to our analysis of the roles that social dance has played in American culture over time. Same course asDANC 2563.

Over the course of the semester, we will examine the visual culture of social dance in order to gain insight into its historical functions as a tool for social cohesion, intercultural exchange, protest/activism, and identity formation, among other things. Through the practice of these dance forms, we will add an experiential component to our analysis of the roles that social dance has played in American culture over time. Same course asART 2563.
