"HISC 60C","What Is Resistance?","Explores the politics of resistance and how different thinkers have conceptualized what it means to resist, why it is necessary, and with what methods it should be done. Side by side with the theorists of resistance, the course analyzes examples of resistance from around the world, traversing different time periods, geographies, and cultures. Examples range from peasant revolts to labor movements, feminist struggles to anti-war mobilizations, prisoner uprisings to anti-colonial wars and contemporary forms of corporeal, self-sacrificial resistance. Relying upon the concrete political problems posed by each historical instance as springboards into larger theoretical concerns, the course focuses on questions such as the nature of power relations, different forms of political organization and representation, the relationship between means and ends, the role of violence, and the function of different media, especially as they become manifest in the complexity of real politics.","5","Banu Bargu"
"HISC 65","What is Belief?","Explores the historical and political conditions in which “belief” has come to characterize people’s relationships to a nonmaterial, spiritual, or supernatural reality. Analyzing the historically recent genesis and differentiation of categories like “religion,” “politics,” and “science,” course examines how the rise to prominence of “belief” is constitutive of modernity as a whole. From these theoretical-historical foundations, course goes on to explore the realms of so-called belief themselves, through case studies on the bodily practices of mystics, prophetically inspired peasant uprisings, and the uncanny reality of UFOs. (Formerly offered as HISC 123, What is Belief?  Mystics, Heretics, and Aliens.)","5","Philip Conklin"

How are we to live, and who are we to become, in an age of ecological unraveling? What is to be done in the realms of politics and culture to ensure a livable future? Course examines histories of freedom as both a concept and practice, giving particular focus to forms of collective liberation that consist in acting together with the earth and the other creatures with whom we share this world.","5","Will Parish"
"HISC 80N","Prophecy Against Empire","In the core of a London slum, with wars raging all around him, the printer William Blake sounded the trumpet of prophecy.

Themes include: questions of orientation and disorientation, production and annihilation, city and hinterland, interior and exterior, subjection and liberation. Also focuses on problems of race and class as they inform capitalism, and experiments with practices of psycho-geography on walks or ""drifts"" across campus. Thinkers discussed include Benjamin, Bachelard, Merleau-Ponty, Lefebvre, Debord, Harvey, Jameson, Gilmore, and others. (Formerly offered as Urban Consciousness: Life, Inequality, and the City.)","5","Stefania Cotei"
"HISC 80S","War and the Media","Examines how histories of war are inextricably tied to histories of media, with a focus on the global War on Terror. Interrogates dominant media and policy approaches to terrorism and their construction of the Islamist ""enemy"" through tropes of backwardness and fanaticism. Seeks instead to situate Islamist movements historically and politically, and in doing so, to consider how Islamist radicalism is deeply intertwined with capitalist modernity, mutually constitutive with contemporary militarism and imperialism, and might darkly mirror other key aspects of contemporary political life.","5","Stefania Cotei"
"HISC 80T","What is the Witch: Terror, Subjectivity, Modernity","What is the witch? A historical person? A vestige of pre-colonial European ancestry? A cultural object whose image and identity are shaped by film, paintings and literature. Class considers the witch's development in Europe.

Explores what concepts should be used to define globalization, must capitalism be global, and how many ""globalizations"" have there been since the 19th century, and what distinguishes them? What forces have caused and maintained inequalities in labor forces across the globe? How does global production isolate, divide, and separate workers from one another? How does it bring them together?","5","Stefania Cotei"
"HISC 80V","Introduction to Marxism","The goal of this course is to introduce students to the thought of Karl Marx and some of the major thinkers working in the Marxist tradition. The majority of the course centers on Marx's writing, though students also read texts that extend and develop Marx's ideas into areas that Marx himself did not explore. Course addresses questions central to the Marxist tradition: What is capital? What is capitalism? What is a capitalist state? How did Marx understand colonialism and national liberation struggles? What is the specific nature of gendered oppression and exploitation under capitalism? What is the relationship between capitalist production and cultural production?","5","Stefania Cotei"
"HISC 80W","What is Imperialism?","Course takes, as its starting point, the formation of the Marxian concept of imperialism in the early 20th century, in the context of centuries of colonialism and the late 19th-century scramble for Africa. Course surveys debates about imperialism in the post-World War period, particularly as they relate to the history of capitalism in the Global South and developments in world trade, finance, and production, leading to consideration of the present moment and grappling with what is novel in global capitalism today.","5","Stefania Cotei"
"HISC 82","Another Brick in the Wall","Pink Floyd's album, The Wall, guides us into exploring what the walls are that make up our world, what they divide and imprison, and how they perpetuate power, but also limits that protect us. From the borders that enclose nation-states to the bodies that give us the illusion of contained selves, students encounter, build or tear down the walls that define knowledge, human, or nonhuman experience. By reading ""the wall"" as a metaphor through a range of texts and media, course investigates the meaning of place, consciousness, and objectivity, while critiquing power structures and systemic oppression in our society.","5","Stefania Cotei"
"HISC 83","White Like Me: Whiteness and the Racial Imaginary","Survey course of antiracism literatures in the U.S. that introduces students to critical whiteness studies, a field of research, thought, and embodied antiracist practice that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s and is currently provoking renewed interest. Students think through the genealogy of whiteness studies and its origins in Black studies and movements to gain ethnic studies programs on campuses in California. Also considers the position of whiteness studies within the fields of critical race and ethnic studies, gender and sexuality studies, and political economy. It is important to note that this course is less a critical response to whiteness studies than an introduction to and survey of the field.","5","Robert Meister"
"HISC 85","Politics and Religion","Considers both the religious sources of political ideas and the political sources of religious ideas, addressing topics, such as sovereignty, justice, love, reason, revelation, sacrifice, victimhood, evil, racism, rebellion, reconciliation, and human rights.","5","Robert Meister"
"HISC 86","After the Human: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the World","Starting from Donna Haraway's ""A Cyborg Manifesto,"" course explores theoretical and myth-making texts that articulate visions of a future beyond humanity. Examines manifestations of the posthuman in film, fiction, and scholarly work. Readings include Haraway, Plato, Descartes, and others. Explores the concept of artificial intelligence as a fascination of science fiction, an engineering objective, a field of study, a philosophical problem, etc. Discussions on: (a) the figure of the thinking machine, its promises and attendant anxieties; (b) the history of ideas leading up to the birth of the field of artificial intelligence in the early 20th century; and (c) the philosophical roots of underlying concepts, such as intelligence, artificiality, agency, mechanism, identity, rationality, logic and free will.","5","Justine Parkin"
"HISC 87","What is Utopia?","Utopia translates to ""no place"" though it sounds identical to another Greek word, ""eutopia,"" or ""good place."" This double meaning speaks to the desire for the ideal society coupled with the very impossibility of its creation. While the term utopia originated in the tradition of political philosophy, this course opens up discussion to a range of utopian thinking in the domains of literature, philosophy, and theory. Some of the questions students tackle are: What are some common elements of utopian imaginaries? Are utopias always already dystopias? How is the concept of utopia connected to the way we shape and experience space? Close reading and discussion of written and visual texts is complemented by analytical and creative writing exercises that engage the themes.","5","Justine Parkin"

"HISC 107","The Idea of Reality","Examines the ""real"" in a variety of registersâfrom realism in art to reality TV, from virtual reality to the real number systemâand asks what, if anything, these usages have in common, what distinguishes the real from the unreal, from the ideal, and from the lie. Through writing, films, and television ranging from the serious to the whimsical, course looks at the ways in which the idea of ""reality"" is invoked, how it is represented, and to what ends.","5","Banu Bargu"
"HISC 108","Parables for a Warming Planet: The Politics of Climate Change","Examines the literary forms of parables, allegories, fables, and other kinds of storytelling as a way of understanding and responding to ecological crises. How can these stories capture the scale and myriad agents of climate change, sea level rise, and species collapse while helping us explore options for a planetary future? What kinds of attention do these forms demand of their readers and how is their simplicity matched by a complexity of possible interpretations? Course also examines the role of figurative language and speculation in the discourse of science. What are the stories that science tells itself? Texts span literature, science, and philosophy with a special interest in the fields of Black feminism, science studies, and Indigenous thought of the Island Pacific.","5","Banu Bargu"

"HISC 137","Why Should I Care?","Have you ever wondered why you should care? Or wished you wouldnât? Caring can be overwhelming. But most people need care, feel they care, or encounter care in one way or another. Caring can feel good, and also awful; it can do good but also be used to control or hurt others. Care can be rigged by inequalities, and power. Care is complicated, but also vital to people, non-humans, and the planet. It matters what happens with care, when we care, and if we donât.

"HISC 142","What is a Person?","The question âwhat is a person?â may seem simple, but upon reflection it is revealed to be complex and contentious. Consider: the vast majority of human beings have historically been denied the status of âpersons,â including most women and racialized peoples. Conversely, there are many non-human entities that have been granted recognition as persons, including corporations, artificial learning systems, even rivers and mountains. So, if âpersonsâ are not merely synonymous with individual biological humans, what are they? This course examines these questions through the scope and nature of personhood from the medieval world to the present, exploring how they touch upon fields such as philosophy, law, politics, science, and the arts.","5","Robert Nichols"

Amid anxieties for the planetâs future, we give attention to tensions between place-based ecological attachments and the perpetuation of nativist and nationalist exclusions, and to how Earth, land, and soil world-makings may appear uneven, unequal and divergent, common and uncommon, as well as inevitably interdependent.","5","Maria Puig de la Bellacasa"

Since the 1980s, scholars of comparative politics have attempted to explain why and when countries transition from authoritarianism to democratic institutions. However, regime change at the national level only sets the stage, leaving deeper questions about what democracy means in practice--how it plays out (or is undermined) throughout the state and at subnational levels; whom it includes and excludes; what options it opens; and what possibilities it forecloses. Such questions relate debates about the potential and the limitations of democracy in general.","5","Benjamin Read"
