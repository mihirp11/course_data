"Entomology and Nematology","Arthropod-borne diseases represent some of the most dangerous and major challenges facing human health. They have shaped the course of history and have remained a threat. Everyone has, at one point or the other, been exposed to the nuisance and bites of arthropods and, therefore, potentially to the diseases they may carry. The effects of these arthropod-borne diseases on human health are increasing and spreading. Factors such as the development of resistant parasite strains to the currently available drugs, and the evolution of insecticide resistance to the currently available insecticides account for this increase and spread. Other factors such as constantly changing climate, trade, unplanned urbanization, changes in agricultural practices, and human travel also aid the establishment of these diseases thereby intensifying disease transmission or causing disease emergence in areas where they were previously unknown. This is a multidisciplinary course that covers concepts and topics from the fields of entomology, medicine, public health, biology, parasitology, microbiology, and veterinary medicine, and will address the interactions of arthropods to humans and the environment. It will present pressing issues relating to the impact of arthropods in public health and will also explore challenging questions such as “what are the emerging issues in vector biology and disease epidemiology”? and “what can be done to manage or prevent the occurrence of arthropod-borne diseases”?

"Food and Resource Economics","When it comes to decisions about scarce resources, the social science known as agricultural economics provides a foundation for informed policy decisions about natural resources such as water and land use; or decisions regarding produced and manufactured resources such as food and clothing. Agricultural economists use a variety of modeling tools to consider optimal behaviors, including how we can reconsider linear systems of production into circular and regenerative ecosystems, referred to as a circular economy. A Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is one systems-thinking tool we use for evaluating complex projects and simple decisions, to evaluate and model the pros and cons of economic decisions. CBA can be applied across a broad array of disciplines including agronomy, engineering, geography, education, medicine, law, finance, human factors, psychology, and many others. CBA project managers and thinkers in society evaluate expectations about rewards (from a decision or action), and costs (including long-term repercussions), to achieve desired outcomes. This course addresses the pressing question, “How can we create and sustain circular food system benefits and evaluate intended and unintended impacts to society from our decisions, to optimize use and conservation efficiency of scarce resources?” As an economic policy tool, we collect, analyze, and communicate research results, build consensus among diverse groups (when it is natural for conflicts to arise), and work towards formulating equitable solutions. The goal of this course is to develop a data-driven perspective through selected readings and experiential classroom activities; to think about factors relevant to the quest by reflecting on knowledge gained; to communicate findings through concise, focused, and goal-oriented analytical writing assignments; to engage in classroom and online discussions to share diverse considerations; and to create a final CBA portfolio model that allows each student to tell a story of their own policy recommendations to design regenerative, resilient, and sustainable circular-food system elements that create value for current and future generations.

"Hamilton School","The modern philosopher David Hume argued that “man, born in a family, is compelled to maintain society, from necessity, from natural inclination, and from habit.” We are all born into a particular political society. Good citizenship demands that we pursue the good of that political society. To do that, we must understand what that society is meant to achieve. In this class, we will explore this essential question: what is America for?  We will reflect on how we, as rational and political animals, share and pass on a particular way of life. We will ask how we can rightly claim that there is one American way of life and one way to live it out when we live in a pluralistic society. We will ask whether American identity and purpose have changed—or remained the same—over time. We will take a multidisciplinary approach to these questions, incorporating elements of philosophy, religion, history, political science, and literature. We will consider the roles of religion and culture, urbanism and ruralism, and tradition and progress as we grapple with this essential question of national purpose.

"Hamilton School","The United States of America has been described as the first nation in the world founded on a creed––a set of beliefs and ideas––rather than the more customary national origins of ethnicity and territory (or “blood and soil”) prevalent in the eighteenth century. It is this unique national nativity that is sometimes regarded as a foundation of the concept of “American exceptionalism.” This sense of creedalism continues to be a defining feature of the American identity, even if its particular features and meanings remain much debated––as they always have been. Thus the animating question for this course: what are the primary beliefs and ideas that shaped the United States at its birth, throughout its history, and into the twenty-first century? Ideas are also inseparable from the people who hold them and advance them. Who are some of the most notable and influential Americans who have developed, even in some cases personified, these ideas? How do they relate, if at all, to the American character and identity over time, and now in our contemporary moment? Using a combination of primary documents, core texts, and secondary readings, this multidisciplinary course will profile a series of ideas and the people who embodied them to trace the development of the United States itself.

Yet less than 75 years ago, in the middle of the twentieth century, they suddenly disappeared throughout the world. How can we explain this transformation? What is the nature of the political world in which we now live? How is it so different to those that have come before – and why? What does it mean for a political community to be independent? This multidisciplinary course considers a stretch in the history of western civilization––from the age of imperialism to the era of global decolonization––in which a world inhabited by empires was replaced by one of nation-states.

"Hamilton School","How does our conception of nature shape our political realities and fortunes? While today we are more aware than ever of the pressures posed by limited resources, fragile ecosystems, and rapidly changing climates, the history of political thought reveals a long-standing awareness of the interdependence between nature, the political edifice and the mediating force of technological development. By tracing out a series of core concepts, this course surveys a series of complex dynamics of dependence, control, crisis, and escape, that govern the interplay between man and his environment. The interdependence of the natural world, the artificial world we create, and the political edifice, often appears as a puzzle: how should we approach nature? What power, if any, does it hold over us? What is the role of artifice and technology in producing and mediating society’s most pressing challenges? How ought we reconcile our dependence upon nature with the desire and need to control certain forces of nature? If today we are more aware than ever of our own impact on our environment, a much longer tradition pays testament to the fact that this complex interplay is a two-way street. Man is, and continues to be, shaped in imperceptible ways by the technologies he produces, as these work with and on nature. This course excavates this rich tradition of social and political texts, through four distinct units that trace this relationship up to the contemporary moment. It offers students an opportunity to gain a wider appreciation of the historical contours of these pressing questions, as well as a renewed look at some of the most topical difficulties of today, including social media, climate change and the impact of our built environments.

"Hamilton School","The question at the heart of this course is: what does it mean to be free and equal? What are the origins of our modern sense of justice, and how did individuals confront powerful and sometimes tyrannical leaders and institutions with new concepts of freedom? When did people and states start to insist that they were free and that they were equal? How do those past meanings differ from our own? This multidisciplinary course considers a stretch of Western civilization’s history—from the Renaissance to the Age of Democratic Revolutions—in which the values and virtues of individual and corporate liberty and equality were insisted upon by authors, artists, and statesmen. In this period there emerged a new way of social and political organization—self-government—and freedom and equality were considered necessary for self-government. This course will trace the emergence of modern conceptions of freedom and equality through reading and viewing a range of works of politics, literature, art and economics.

We will pursue answers to this problem through a study of ancient Western drama and philosophy. We will read Plato and Aristotle Stoics to grapple with classical philosophical accounts of the relationship between virtue, practical reasoning, and human flourishing. We will also read four tragedies: Sophocles’ Antigone and Oedipus the King, Aeschylus’s Prometheus Bound, and Euripides’ Hecabe. Through our study of these plays, we will explore questions concerning ethics, responsibility, and luck. We will reflect on how the study of philosophy and dramatic literature can enrich our experience and understanding of each, and how that knowledge can help move us through the deepest difficulties of life.

"Hamilton School","This course explores the concept of the common good, as articulated in philosophy and illustrated in drama, literature, and film. We begin by studying the blueprint for a concept of the common good that Aristotle sets out in the Politics and Nicomachean Ethics, and its full development in St. Thomas Aquinas. Armed with this theoretical background, we apply ourselves to questions such as: how should regimes and authority figures provide for the common good through the law? What does pursuing the common good involve when the demands of justice are in tension with general beneficence? How compatible is value pluralism with the pursuit of the common good? We will read Sophocles, Lincoln, Martin Luther King, and St. Thomas More, among others, to reflect on the nature of leadership, justice, dissent, and principle, and how we can pursue the common good while remaining true to our conscience.

"Hamilton School","Why spy? Spying has long been an important part of how countries relate to each other and defend themselves. But why do they do it? This course will approach this question from several different perspectives by reading stories of Cold War espionage (both fiction and nonfiction). We will examine it at a national level, asking what role intelligence plays in countries’ foreign policy and international relations. We will examine it at a personal level, asking why people choose to join their countries’ intelligence services, and why some people choose to spy on their own countries for foreign governments. We will also pose it skeptically, asking how we ought to think about morality and immorality in a world full of deception. Along the way, we will also consider bigger questions that the world of spy craft poses for our everyday lives and in relationship to Western thought. What is the role of knowledge and information in decision-making? What level of uncertainty and risk are we willing to accept when making big decisions? How can we trust that what we know is true?

"Hamilton School","What justifies the use of force? No democratic citizen is exempt from considering this question, but our answers are often contradictory jumbles. To gain clarity we will explore the works that laid the moral foundation for the modern way of war, from the Bible and the Iliad to the thought of Karl Marx. In this interdisciplinary course you will discuss poems, plays, films, histories, and philosophical accounts about war in the Western canon and beyond. Its subtitle could be “From Zeus to the Atom Bomb,” because we will be traveling from the Classical to the Nuclear Age. Combining the techniques of literary studies, philosophy, history, and religious studies, we will strive to understand our own responses to arguments, works of art, visions, and fantasies about the nature of war. How have these cultural forms influenced the crucial decisions of human beings, and how do they impact our thinking now? We will also consider scientific explanations for the ubiquity and persistence of warfare, wondering whether natural science alone can explain human conflict. Lastly, we will consider if we have entered a “post-modern” phase of war, with the War in Ukraine as our object of consideration, a war documented in dizzying detail on social media.

"Hamilton School","Can war be just? What is a ‘just cause’? The idea that war can and should be just holds a middle position between the refusal to impose any moral restraints on the waging of war (realism) and the rejection of all warfare as immoral (pacificism). Western just war theories gradually developed from the confluence of Greek philosophy, Roman Law, and the Judeo-Christian scriptural tradition. Just war theory asks two essential questions. Is the cause for going to war just (jus ad bellum)? And, Is the conduct of the war just (jus in bello)? This multidisciplinary course surveys just war thinking from antiquity to the First World War. It includes historical case studies so that students can develop their own concepts of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. Grading Scheme:Letter Grade","ISS 1712","Just War","3 Credits"
"Hamilton School","For centuries, generals have searched for an “art of war” that could be used to defeat their enemy but what is an “art of war”? The art of war is closely tied to the term “strategy.” Strategy derives from the ancient Greek word strategos. Translated literally it means ""the general's art."" In general, it refers to military matters such as the overall conduct of a war. Likewise for centuries, military practitioners and theorists have written on strategy and the key figures who have shaped the theory and practice of war and statecraft. This multidisciplinary course provides global, comparative perspectives on strategic thought from antiquity to today, surveying both classical and current themes of strategy in search of an “art of war.” It includes historical case-studies from the Western canon so that students can develop their own concepts of strategy and the art of war.

"Hamilton School","How does war shape the human condition? In the present era, Western countries are generally sheltered from war. But this is an anomaly. Most human societies have had to reckon with war and grapple with its effects. Moreover, they have tended to regard this reckoning as important for developing their own way of life. Without that reckoning, their societies might atrophy, ossify, and slide into decadence. The resurgence of concerns about the potential for open warfare between China, Russia, and the United States demonstrates the need to consider war’s effects and the persistent questions its possibility poses for human societies. This discussion-driven course explores war’s effects on the human condition through a variety of disciplines and approaches. To study these effects we draw from philosophy, literature, ancient and modern history, and illustrate these effects through a number of literary sources, including drama, novels, memoirs, and film. Grading Scheme:Letter Grade","ISS 1716","War and the Human Condition","3 Credits"
"Hamilton School","What does it mean to live in a secular age? How does living in a secular age offer new opportunities and challenges for the perennial human quest for meaning? This multi-disciplinary course tackles these fundamental questions. Drawing on philosophy, sociology, and political science from the Western canon, we will examine three senses of secularity. The first is a political sense, where religion is largely if not entirely removed from public life, as is the case in many modern liberal democracies. The second sense of secularity is sociological, and it is identified with a situation in which there has been significant decline in religious belief and practice (recently discussed in terms of the rise of the “nones,” that is, those who answer “none” when asked for their religious affiliation). The third sense of secularity is an existential sense, where it has to do with a change in the circumstances of the human quest for meaning, namely, where there has been a move from a condition in which a traditional religious outlook was taken for granted to one where it is regarded as one option among others. This third sense of secularity will be our primary focus, though we will also be concerned with its relationship to the other two senses of secularity. In exploring the existential (or lived) sense of secularity, we will examine philosophical writings on meaning in life from religious, secular, and spiritual-but-non-religious perspectives, seeking to understand what makes for a worthwhile life. Finally, we will explore how secularization has influenced politics today on both sides of the political spectrum and consider what role spirituality and religiosity might still have in public life.

"Hamilton School","What does it mean to be a ‘person’? How does the person relate to other people, to society, and to God? Some of the greatest writers, philosophers, poets, and artists of the Russian nineteenth century considered the questions of the revolutionary transformation of society and the restoration of faith from the standpoint of the individual person. For them, not just philosophy, but also literature, poetry, and visual art were paths to understanding the self and its purpose in the world. By considering questions of identity and appearance, activism and contemplation, reason and irrationality through seemingly prosaic themes such as fingernails, overcoats, and simple arithmetic, this course will reveal a variety of perspectives of the nature and value of human personality and ask students to reflect on their own approach to the person in the modern age and in relation to Western tradition.

"Music","How does music crystallize moments in our history, memory, and collective experience as humans? We all live with an ever-growing personal soundtrack, and even decades later, music can bring us back to certain important moments in our lives. The same is true of collective memory, when music is the result of, or becomes associated with, monumental human movements and events: arts and literature, religion, political and societal upheaval. In this class we will use pivotal pieces in Western classical music as a lens to examine different angles of our human history. We will examine the historical circumstances, politics, religion, and psychology that fomented the landscape of music being composed and performed, and how that landscape consequently affected our sense of collective culture and identity. We will examine the complicated legacy of music as it captures and expresses cultural norms in an ever-changing world. As students learn about these factors, they will also examine and reflect upon how this knowledge impacts their own understanding and subjective experience. This class aspires to help each individual build their own vocabulary for expressing the fundamental connections between music, society, culture, and the human experience. No prior musical experience or literacy is required, only a willingness to listen with intention. Grading Scheme:Letter Grade","MUH 1006","Music as a Time Capsule","3 Credits"

Drawing on recent themes in the growing field of Ecomusicology, we will seek to deepen our understanding of how we relate to the environment and become more aware of the central place of sound and the environment in our lives.
