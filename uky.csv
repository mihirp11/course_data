"","FOR 310","INTRODUCTION TO FOREST HEALTH AND PROTECTION","Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food and Environment     Forest health is a ubiquitous goal in forest management. Everyone wants a healthy forest but what exactly does this mean? Definitions of what constitutes a healthy forest vary widely and can be different depending on forest type, management goals, and spatial scale. Tree health is an important part of forest health, but the two things are not synonymous. A wide range of abiotic and biotic factors can contribute to the decline of trees. While some level of mortality is healthy in natural systems (and unavoidable), other threats can jeopardize entire forests and/or forestry operations. Invasive insects and diseases are perhaps the most noticeable threats, causing widespread tree mortality and changing forest ecosystems worldwide. Many other stressors, from native species to extreme weather, cause occasional or incremental damage that can predispose trees to other factors or act synergistically to decrease forest health overall. This course will introduce forest health and lay the foundation for future courses in the forestry major, providing future forestry professionals with the skills to recognize and maintain forests that are sustainable and meet management goals.

"College of Nursing","NUR 518","LOVE YOURSELF: INTRODUCTION TO MINDFULNESS & WELLNESS","This course introduces the practice of mindfulness, the ability to fully attend to the present with curiosity, openness, and interest. Research shows that practicing mindfulness reduces unproductive worry about the future and rumination about the past. It helps students build skills for managing stress, clarifying their own values and goals, and acting in accordance with them, which often improves academic productivity, the quality of relationships with others, and general happiness and well- being.  Although mindfulness was originally discussed in Eastern meditation traditions, this course takes a secular and scientific perspective. Mindfulness is understood as a set of skills that anyone can develop through practice. Just as physical exercise improves strength and fitness, evidence suggests that developing oneâ€™s mental mindfulness ‘muscles’ reduces fear, anxiety, and depression and facilitates wise decision-making in stressful situations.  As with any mental or physical skill (like learning to solve math problems or ride a bicycle) mindfulness requires practice and may feel awkward and uncomfortable at first. This course is designed in a logical sequence that builds skills gradually through brief lectures, discussions, short in-class exercises, out-of-class assignments, and brief essays. For most people, the rewards of learning mindfulness skills are a happier, more focused, more satisfying life.","3"

"College of Arts and Sciences","PHI 393","PHILOSOPHY OF FILM","This course will examine the aesthetics of film from the early 20th Century to the present. Instead of using films to discuss philosophical issues, we will discuss the philosophical issues that film as an aesthetic medium raises. The aesthetic-for us, medium of film- is thus understood as irreducible to the traditional division in philosophy between practical philosophy (ethics, political philosophy) and theoretical philosophy (epistemology, metaphysics). The aesthetic brings with it its own set of rules, chief among them is the idea that it’s rules cannot be set out in advance of its product. We will thus be discussing art (film) as what generates a new theoretical discourse about it at each turn. The theoretical discourse, however, is in lively conversation with the product it seeks to understand and must change as the object itself evolves. What is more, film products themselves constitute their own proper critique of their own tradition in the sense that, for instance, the depth of field shot followed on from the formal constraints of the montage technique. This course will also have a practical component. Each student will create a short film (on a selected topic) which will then be shown to the class as a whole and subjected to (friendly) critique in class by all as well as in writing by a group of students. The film will then be reworked to address suggestions, reshown again so that others may comment upon it both in writing and in their own films. In this way, students will both be able to make theoretical and practical comments on each other’s work.   Meets UK Core: Intellectual Inquiry in Arts and Creativity.","3"

As a part of this, the class also explores how sports themselves are tied to the politics and laws relating to gender, race, and class.  This class will explore these dynamics primarily using a topical approach, covering a variety of topics that examine the connections between sports, politics and law. These topics will include: how sports play a role in American life and interact with the government institutions, the political economy of sports, how sports are used in international politics, sports at universities, health and well-being, as well as examining issues involving the intersection of sports and race, gender, and class.  Importantly, you do not have to be a ‘fan’ of any particular sport to see, analyze, and understand the importance of these connections. And, in fact, being a super fan may actually make it harder. In sum, this course is designed to examine sports, which are typically thought of as a leisure or entertainment activity, and to understand how sports are much more and that they can reflect, magnify and impact the concerns and issues found in society.

Working on either side of the Iron Curtainâ€”Kubrick in England and the United States, Tarkovsky in the Soviet Unionâ€”, these two directors allow us to think through some of the biggest questions and challenges of the Cold War: capitalism versus communism, nuclear proliferation, the space race, the trauma of World War II, consumerism, Vietnam, and the 1960s counterculture. Additionally, Tarkovsky and Kubrick were two self- stylized ‘masculine’ filmmakers, who cared deeply about projecting an image of themselves, and their work, in a traditional ‘manly’ light as daring and uncompromising. We will use their films to study how masculinity is differently presented on screen and to examine the gendered politics of Cold War society: the rise of feminism, sexual liberation, the crisis of male identity in the 1950s, the gay rightsâ€™ movement, and the ‘lavender scare.’ This is an introductory course that does not require a background in history or film studies.

We will begin by a brief examination of Japan’s earlier wars in the modern period, including the Meiji Restoration (1867-8), the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-5), and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5) in order to set Japan’s modern wars in context; of particular focus here will be the emergence and the development of Japan’s Emperor-centered, militaristic nationalism, which influenced every aspect of Japanese thought during the Asia-Pacific War. Themes covered will include both politics and culture of a nation at war.  We will look not only at the political and military strategists and foreign relations, but also at the life on the battlefront and the home front.  The cult of death, which centered around the belief that those who sacrifice their lives for the emperor for the sake of the nation will be honored as a god at Yasukuni Shrine, and which resulted in such fanatical actions as kamikaze attacks and mass suicides, will be investigated in detail. The last sessions of the class will cover the legacies of the Asia-Pacific War in the decades following Japan’s defeat.  The course requires - no prior knowledge of the history of modern Japan.

"College of Nursing","NUR 348","INTRODUCTION TO MINDFULNESS","This course introduces the practice of mindfulness, the ability to fully attend to the present with curiosity, openness, and interest. Research shows that practicing mindfulness reduces unproductive worry about the future and rumination about the past. It helps students build skills for managing stress, clarifying their own values and goals, and acting in accordance with them, which often improves academic productivity, the quality of relationships with others, and general happiness and well- being.  Although mindfulness was originally discussed in Eastern meditation traditions, this course takes a secular and scientific perspective. Mindfulness is understood as a set of skills that anyone can develop through practice. Just as physical exercise improves strength and fitness, evidence suggests that developing oneâ€™s mental mindfulness ‘muscles’ reduces fear, anxiety, and depression and facilitates wise decision-making in stressful situations.  As with any mental or physical skill (like learning to solve math problems or ride a bicycle) mindfulness requires practice and may feel awkward and uncomfortable at first. This course is designed in a logical sequence that builds skills gradually through brief lectures, discussions, short in-class exercises, out-of-class assignments, and brief essays. For most people, the rewards of learning mindfulness skills are a happier, more focused, more satisfying life.","1"

This course responds to this emerging social reality by aiming to help professionals develop knowledge and skills to observe, interact with, speak and listen to, interpret, analyze, read, and write about people with different cultural backgrounds. To this end, the course requires each student to conduct a mini-ethnographic project in the context of her/his everyday professional life. This project, in turn, will be placed in critical dialogue with some of the basic questions of intercultural communication, such as: (1) what is culture? (2) what is communication? (3) In what ways do people who do not share the same rules (e.g., a ‘native’ and a ‘foreigner,’ an adult and a child, a man and a woman, etc.) communicate? In considering these and other questions, we critically examine how an established linear stage model of intercultural communication, based on the notion of the ‘mastery of rules,’ capture and/or fail to capture complexities of intercultural communication. In so doing, we will also explore intercultural competence as ‘the ability to get along with other players of a language-game, a game played without referees’ (to borrow from American philosopher Richard Rortyâ€™s words), while assessing merits and demerits of such a conceptualization in reference to student projects.
