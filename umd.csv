By analyzing a variety of narrative, documentary, major studio, and independent films, we will seek to understand how American films' representations of rural, urban, and suburban spaces both reflect, contradict, and often influence our lived experiences of these spaces; in other words, this course will examine how the ""reel"" intersects with the ""real"".

This course explores sustainable pest management in agroecosystems using the integrated pest management (IPM) paradigm. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties. Pesticides are used only after monitoring indicates they are needed according to established guidelines, and treatments are made with the goal of removing only the target organism. Pest control materials are selected and applied in a manner that minimizes risks to human health, beneficial and non-target organisms, and the environment.

"ENST - Environmental Science and Technology","Historically, with the exception of certain locations, water has been available in sufficient quantities, and providing supporting infrastructure has been relatively straightforward. In urban areas, the concentration of people and the drastic changes in land use, have altered the fluxes of water, sediments, chemicals, and microorganisms. As the population increases and the number of large urban areas keeps growing (both in U.S. and internationally), managing water in urban areas is becoming more challenging. Water must be supplied for domestic, commercial, and industrial use, as well as irrigation and maintaining and enhancing local environments (e.g., urban streams). In addition, stormwater must be managed to prevent flooding and environmental damage, and used water, which contains organic matter, nutrients, and other constituents that can be extracted and reused, must be collected and managed.

"SPAN - Spanish","The period that precedes the Renaissance has been traditionally labeled as the ""dark"" Middle Ages and it is common to associate an evil, brutality and barbarian life style with the time span comprised of between the 5th and the 15th centuries. This undergraduate seminar does not intend to embellish the truth or to minimize the hardships of life and death at the time of the Crusades. In fact, an objective timeline of historical events that marked that period as middle will be provided, and the central question to be addressed in this class is, ""Middle of what""? As we try to answer it, we will be able to examine many ""modern"" aspects of the Middle Ages. Some of them have been highlighted since the beginning of the 20th century and justify a view of the Middle Ages as a bright and ""modern"" period in which, while overcoming despicable difficulties and a lack of facilities, the most precious treasures of our times were intellectually conceived, manufactured, built, and written.

It provides an overview of generalized linear models (GLM) that encompass non-normal response distributions to model functions of the mean. GLMs thus relate the expected mean E(Y) of the dependent variable to the predictor variables via a specific link function. This link function permits the expected mean to be non-linearly related to the predictor variables. Examples for GLMs are the logistic regression, regressions for ordinal data, or regression models for count data. GLMs are generally estimated by use of maximum likelihood estimation.

"SURV - Survey Methodology","Measurement error in survey data can significantly distort analyses of substantive interest. Means, totals, and proportions will be off if the average answer people give is inaccurate. However, measurement error distorts not only estimates of means but can also severely bias apparent relationships, conditional probabilities, means differences, and other regression-type analyses. To remove such biases it is therefore essential to estimate the extent of measurement error in survey variables. This can be done using a gold standard or, in the absence of such a standard, modeling the error.
