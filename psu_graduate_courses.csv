"Acoustics (ACS)","ACS 501","Elements of Acoustics and Vibration","Vibrational acoustics including mechanical oscillation, forced and damped response, vibration of strings, membranes, rods, bars, and plates.ACS 501Elements of Acoustics and Vibration (3) Acoustics is a broad subject that crosses and interacts with many engineering, science, mathematics, medical, and artistic disciplines. This course provides a thorough foundation necessary for studying structural acoustics and vibration problems and the exploration of acoustic waves in solids. A detailed analysis of the single-degree-of-freedom mechanical mass-spring system provides the building block for exploring lumped-element models of more complicated acoustic systems and the phenomena of resonance for forced and damped systems. Multiple-degree-of-freedom mechanical systems are used to investigate the coupled oscillation between oscillating systems, the design of vibration absorbers, and methods for modeling the low frequency behavior of guitars, violins, and vented-boxed loudspeakers. Extending the mass-spring model to an infinite number of degrees-of-freedom leads to a development of the wave equation and its solutions for longitudinal acoustic waves in elastic solids. Boundary conditions and the concept of mechanical impedance are used to explore standing waves in a bounded elastic medium and the transmission of waves between media with different elastic properties. Transverse waves on an elastic string, while fundamentally different from longitudinal waves, obey the same differential equation of motion and the same application of boundary conditions and mechanical impedance. For both longitudinal and transverse wave systems, the mechanical impedance approach and the method of separation of variables are used to study systems with specified boundary conditions. Longitudinal and transverse waves in structures with varying cross-section, density, or elastic properties are also explored. Torsional waves in elastic solids are explored with application to systems with various cross-sectional shapes. Membranes serve as a two-dimensional extension of transverse waves on an elastic string, and provide mode shapes which may be described using rectangular and cylindrical coordinates (with Bessel function solutions). The fourth-order differential equation of motion for flexural bending vibrations of thin beams is derived and solutions are explored using the separation of variables approach for boundary value problems. Finally, the flexural vibration of two-dimensional rectangular and circular plates are investigated. Homework problem sets will illustrate theory and applications to real world problems.","3 Credits"
"Acoustics (ACS)","ACS 502","Elements of Waves in Fluids","Thermodynamic and hydrodynamic foundations of linear acoustics in fluids with applications to lumped-elements, reflection, refraction, radiation, attenuation, enclosures, and waveguides. The purpose of this course is to provide the foundation for understanding the behavior of waves in fluids in the ""linear acoustic"" limit for first-year graduate students entering the Graduate Program in Acoustics. The course provides a common ground for students coming from a broad range of varying undergraduate programs in sciences, engineering, mathematics, and the arts. This self-consistent foundation will be built upon an understanding of thermodynamics and the consequences for the behavior of gases and gas mixtures (i.e., ideal gas equations-of-state, heat capacity), and hydrodynamics (both dissipative and non-dissipative) as expressed from the Eulerian perspective. This perspective will be used to develop techniques for understanding oscillations in lumped-element acoustical networks that are smaller than the wavelength of sound and will be applied to extended media in which waves propagate, are reflected and transmitted through interfaces between media with different acoustical properties, and are refracted through media with continuously-varying acoustical properties. The same equations will be applied to the excitation of sound waves that propagate in 3-dimensions by vibrating bodies that are smaller than the wavelength of sound. Those results will be extended by superposition of such ""compact sources"" to produce both discrete and continuous one- and two-dimensional arrays. The directional properties and strength of such extended sources will be examined. The behavior of sound within 3-dimentional rectangular enclosures is studied via the method of ""separation of variables"" to identify the sound modes in such enclosures, their characteristic frequencies, and the selective excitation and detection of such modes. The frequency dependence of the density of modes is introduced to motivate the relationship between the modal and raytracing (i.e., ballistic) perspectives. The techniques of ""statistical energy analysis"" will be applied such enclosures to quantify architectural phenomena such as reverberation time and critical distance. Those results will be extended to non-rectangular enclosures and to rectangular and cylindrical waveguides, focusing on the concept of group and phase speed and the coupling of sources to planewave and higher-order waveguide modes. Attenuation of sound waves is also treated from the hydrodynamic perspective and results are derived for boundary-layer dissipation, classical thermoviscous sound absorption within bulk fluids, and the relaxation-time approximation is applied for sound absorption by chemical association-dissociation in seawater and the effects of humidity on collision-times in air. Problem sets that illustrate the theory and applications are a central component of this course.","3 Credits"

In order to obtain the desired properties, these materials are subjected to a range of thermo-mechanical processing steps and post-processing heat treatments which drive phase transformations while the material is in the solid state. The mechanisms of these solid-state phase transformations involve a wide range of fundamental materials science concepts, including crystallography, nucleation, grain growth, and diffusion. Practitioners must have knowledge across a range of materials disciplines, including thermodynamics, kinetics, and crystallography, in order to synthesize and capture the complex processes occurring over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Knowledge of these fundamental concepts along with their interactions over a range of length scales is applicable across a range of conventional and emerging materials processing fields, from primary steelmaking through heat treatment of nickel and aluminum-base alloys through the additive manufacturing of a wide range of advanced materials. In this course, a comprehensive study of solid state phase transformations in metallic materials will be undertaken.

"Adult Education (ADTED)","ADTED 515","Foundations of Educational Research","Students read the philosophical foundations of education research, study how philosophies influence methodologies, and analyze current educational problems. This course is designed for students entering doctoral programs in the College of Education. Our students are studying to become education researchers within a highly politicized environment. For example, particular definitions of education research and government policies that favor some types of research practices over others provide opportunities for and set limits upon the work of education researchers. Public controversies likewise contribute to challenges faced by education researchers who find their work affirmed or discounted by particular definitions and policies. In order to explore these controversies and to allow students to begin identifying their own ""positionality"" with regard to research, this course begins with a reading of the history and philosophies of education research (primarily focusing on the United States). The course goals are: -     to identify underlying assumptions of competing forms of social inquiry, each determined to uncover new knowledge; -     to bring those assumptions to bear on education research in chosen fields of study; and -     to begin to develop one's own positions in order to direct further study and research. Specifically, through instructor facilitation and group discussions, students will come to understand major philosophical perspectives that permeate and drive research methodologies in education: positivism, postpositivism, interpretivism, critical theory, poststructuralism, and pragmatism. These understandings allow students to recognize the methodological assumptions that inform published research studies and to discover how methodologies might inform the research they wish to conduct as students and practitioners. Although the course is not required by any particular doctoral program in the College of Education, it is suggested for students who consider research important to their future careers and who see benefits in exploring the methodological options available.","3 Credits/Maximum of 999"

"African American Studies (AFAM)","AFAM 525","Trans of Color Critique","A history of transgender struggle has fomented intellectual formations that interrogate racial and gendered logics and proffer alternative structures of engagement, but commitment to any conceptualization of trans critique has often fallen back on assumptive ascriptions to non-racial analysis. Gathered at the concomitant study of race, gender, sexuality, class, and socio-spatiality, Trans of Color Critique provides an opportunity to (re)consider the analytical and material possibilities and tensions tendered by the articulation of transgender and non-white. Engaging with trans (and queer) of color theory as a particular approach to the political and as its own mode of knowledge production, we will not only take up the mutual constitution of race and gender, but center how whiteness has come to construct the burgeoning field of trans studies. In this graduate seminar we will consider the ways in which these multiply marginalized knowledges aim a critical challenge at our Western knowledge traditions. The course considers how race as a modality of analysis and trans of color critique as a praxis can in turn amplify, extend, and complicate the framework and analytical interventions offered by trans studies. Rather than attempt to be exhaustive, we will focus on the urgent interventions offered by trans of color critical theory, especially as it relates to foundational disruptions of Western epistemologies, medicalization, humanism, movement and displacement, decolonial critique, carcerality, violence and death, and futurity.","3 Credits"

While this is a political science course, the seminar draws ideas and insights from a broad array of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. It demonstrates that an explicit consideration of race is needed to fully comprehend American politics. Students emerge from the course with an understanding of the scholarly approaches and key substantive debates.","3 Credits"
"African American Studies (AFAM)","AFAM 553","Comparative Racial and Ethnic Politics","Since its founding, the United States has had to balance the American creed of equality for all, on one hand, with racial inequality, on the other hand. Is this challenge something exclusive to the United States? This course will provide students the opportunity to analyze how race and ethnicity are constructed across the globe as well as how race and politics interact across state borders. Students will examine how race is constructed and racial ideologies are developed in several countries including the U.S., South Africa, France, Australia and Brazil. By the end of the semester, students should be able to fully engage and contribute to broad literatures on the politics and policy of race and racism. They should readily be able to answer questions such as: What role do countries and their institutions play in developing racial ideologies and racial hierarchies? What political purpose do ideologies such as ""racial democracy"" serve? How might social scientists best compare notions such as U.S.'s ""race problem,"" Latin America's ""shade problem"" and Europe's ""immigrant problem""? What are the perils of cross-border comparisons, and how, if possible, can social scientists account for state differences in their analyses? The major objectives of the course are to: (1) analyze the effects of historical, social, economic, cultural and global forces on the development of racial and ethnic politics in various countries; (2) define and critically analyze concepts relevant to the study of racial and ethnic politics; (3) identify, critique and apply major academic theories and debates regarding issues of race, ethnicity, inequality and reconciliation; (4) build analytical skills so that students will be able to effectively engage and communicate in public and scholarly discourse about race and ethnic politics; (5) improve writing skills, especially as they relate to manuscript and book reviews; (6) become cognizant of the difficulties that scholars must navigate as they approach topics related to the politics, race, ethnicity as well as comparative/cross-state analysis; and (7) develop a series of best practices to address methodological and theoretical challenges to studying race comparatively.","3 Credits"

In the seminar, students will explore key debates and issues in the field while examining the diversity of theoretical and methodological approaches that scholars of African Studies have used to approach these debates. Through research articles that each employ a different set of methodological tools to examine questions of modernity and tradition, development, gender, ethnicity, conflict, and transnationalism, students will understand the possible approaches that can be employed to identify a research questions, gather evidence, and analyze it. Through reading and discussing such research articles, and discussing with scholars who visit class to present their research, students will gain conceptual tools to advance a research project in methodologically-grounded ways. While some topics will apply more directly to the student's individual research project, the themes studied are those that all scholars of African Studies should have some knowledge and mastery over, and each module will give students an opportunity to experiment by applying the theory and methods referenced in the scholarly literature to primary sources relevant to the student's own research.

"African Studies (AFR)","AFR 526","African Social and Cultural Systems","The African continent may be the most diverse of all the continents in its composition of ethnic groups, social and kinship arrangements, belief systems, and political processes. Its cultures have been subjected to further transformation by different colonial governance structures, decolonial apparatuses, differing ideals of modernity, and differing interactions with religions like Christianity and Islam. However, with all the differences and transformations, what are the elements that tell us about societies across the continent? This course details various social and cultural systems, from a regional perspective, to provide background knowledge to help students develop their understanding of the many different societies on the continent. The regional focus is further divided by into topics such as kinship relations, governance, and religion. As each region and topic area is covered, students will begin to understand areas of intersection, fissures brought by modernity, bridges and divides across ethnicities and regions: Kinship This subsection of the course on kinship provides an analysis of how kinship theories of social formation can facilitate our understanding of the different dimensions of African social practices in historical and contemporary Africa. It propels students' understanding of multiple theories of kinship, with a focus on the relationships between kinship and life-span relations, pension sharing, circular migration, gender, politics, and patronage. Governance Most African countries, irrespective of their degree of economic sophistication, are characterized economically by dual forms of governance-one that derives its authority from the state and the other that may be construed as traditional. The traditional governance section of the course addresses three overarching questions: (1) Why have traditional institutions of governance remained relatively robust in post-independent Africa even when faced with relatively hostile governments? (2) What are the levels of adherence and allegiance of rural Africans to traditional institutions? and (3) How are disputes resolved within traditional institutions? Religion There are three dominant forms of religions in Africa: Christianity, Islam, and Traditional African religions. These practices of these religions were affected by the experiences of colonialism and postcolonialism as well as Africa's subsequent integration into the global economy. All of these religions are related to various forms of social organization, authority, and power and may vary between regions and ethnic groups.","3 Credits"

Rather, these are deep-seated challenges to the core tenets of language research as well as new directions for theories and practices on language research in the Global South in general. A renewal of southern epistemologies requires an understanding of the absences such knowledge implies. To engage with the transformative potential of non-Eurocentric thinking, the course explores the relevance of a decolonial imagination that makes it possible to envisage an alternative reality and justice that engenders""radical hope."" Topics central to the course are the decolonization of research methods, feministic perspectives on African languages, Southern Multilingualisms and education, digitization of African cultural practices, indigeneity, an engagement with ""Indigenous cosmovisions,"" and reinvented traditional concepts, such as ubuntu or sumac kawsay, that suggest that the formation of other worlds is feasible. These newly reinvented cosmovisions render it feasible to move beyond the limitations of Western-centric politics and knowledge production. The course is far more than a critique of the Global North's scholarship. It will cultivate a decolonial imagination, consequently producing African language knowledge with the South, and not on the South.","3 Credits"

Readings will allow students to develop a critical understanding of the ideology and epistemology of environmental management, resource control, rural development and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Students will be encouraged to interrogate modernist doctrines such as population-environment narratives, poverty-stewardship narratives and related environmental ideologies/narratives that embody sustainability and rural (under)development in sub-Saharan Africa. Through case study examples, students will use these conceptual foundations to trace the relationships between sustainability and poverty in a number of livelihood systems and resource control regimes. Some examples are resource (land/water) management between the state and nomadic pastoral systems; land reform and rural peasant livelihood systems; mining and rural livelihood systems; and national parks, trans-frontier parks and rural livelihood systems.","3 Credits"

This seminar examines the extractive industry-driven changes in Africa's political economy, as well as in the continent's foreign relations. Students will examine the institutional basis under which the expansion of the industry is taking place in Africa. This will involve discussions of the institutional characteristics of Africa, including issues of land tenure and property rights laws, how institutional systems are changing in order to facilitate the industry's expansion, and the repercussions of these changes upon society. The course also interrogates the relevance of international efforts to mitigate some of the adverse impacts of the industry. Among such efforts is the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. Overall this seminar examines the industry's impact on Africa's socioeconomic development and global relations, and concludes with how African countries might deal with the adverse impact of the Oil and Mining industry.","3 Credits"

CI ED (ADTED/AFR) 543 Comparative and International Trends in Adult Literacy Education (3) This course provides a comparative synthesis of what is known about literacy education and adult learning and what it will mean for the 21st century: the context in which literacy takes place; who participates; what they learn and why; the nature of the learning processes; new approaches to adult learning; social media and mobile devices; development theory in adult learning; and other issues relevant to understanding literacy education and adult learning in sociocultural, political, and international contexts. It also examines the newer approaches to adult learning: embodied, spiritual and narrative learning; learning and knowing in non-western perspectives; and cultural theory, poststructural and feminist perspectives. This course investigates questions such as: What does it mean to be literate in the 21st century? Why are teachers experiencing difficulty teaching students skills needed to understand and produce written work? Can schools in the 21st century inundated with digital technologies help students navigate the new literacies? How should adult literacy participants deal with the reality of new media and new literacies? What is the role of non-governmental organizations in this crisis? Overall, this course challenges graduate students to engage other international and non-western frameworks of learning and knowing to think about the purpose of education and learning as well as question the nature of knowledge production itself.","3 Credits"

Such diseases are therefore of great importance in human ecology and demography. Yet anthropologists have paid scant attention to the implications of infectious diseases for human populations, especially populations in the past. This course attempts to correct that oversight. The course is designed for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in anthropology and related fields (biology, population studies, health sciences). The primary focus will be the role of infectious diseases in human population ecology, but enough background will be provided on the biology of infectious diseases to make the course as self-contained as possible. Thus, we will review basic information about the biology of pathogen-host interactions, including some elementary microbiology and immunobiology. (Note that the course is not intended to replace introductory-level courses in those fields.)We will also discuss the evolutionary arms race between the human host and its pathogens, especially in the evolution of pathogen virulence.Once this basic background has been provided, the remainder of the course will deal with infectious diseases in past human populations. What was the role of infectious diseases in population regulation? How did human population structure affect infectious disease dynamics? How did infectious diseases contribute to the mortality ""crises"" that are known to have affected many preindustrial societies?To address these questions, we will review recent insights based on mathematical models of the epidemic process. The focus will not be on the mathematics per se--indeed, students need not have any special mathematical background. But they will be expected to learn Stella, a computer language for dynamic modeling. (Stella was chosen because it is easy to learn, and yet allows construction of sophisticated models without requiring any attention to the underlying math.) Toward the middle of the semester, students will break into 2-4 groups, each of which will select a particular disease or class of diseases, develop some models of them using Stella, and present the results to the class as a whole. The entire class will then work together to explore and extend the models developed by the separate groups.Grading will be based on the group presentations, in which all students are required to participate. Participation in general classroom discussion will also be taken into account. Since the class will combine formal lectures with a more seminar-like format, active student participation is essential for a good grade. This course will be offered once a year with an enrollment of 15.","3 Credits"

"Anthropology (ANTH)","ANTH 575","Population, Food, and Traditional Farming","This course explores the relationship between demographic processes (fertility, mortality, migration) and traditional farming, especially farming near the subsistence level.ANTH 575Population, Food, and Traditional Farming (3) This course explores the complex relationship between demographic processes and traditional agriculture. It starts with the premise that traditional agriculture, at least agriculture near the subsistence level, is primarily demographic in its motivation: the main purpose of a small-scale, preindustrial family farm is to create and support a family, i.e. produce children (fertility) and keep them alive (survival). This idea will be the starting point for re-examining existing theories about population and agriculture, and for formulating new models of the traditional farming household as a demographic enterprise. Some of the topics to be addressed include: (1) the slippery concepts of 'population pressure', 'over-population', 'population regulation', 'carrying capacity', and 'sustainability'; (2) some basic ecology and economics of subsistence production and consumption; (3) the debate over agricultural intensification; (4) the effects of under-nutrition on fertility and mortality; (5) the nature of the household labor force; (6) the household demographic life cycle and its economic implications; (7) seasonality and the allocation of household labor; (8) the demography of the 'hungry season' (9) risk management and food shortages; and (10) household wealth differentials and their demographic implications. The first half of the course will be in lecture format, the second will be more like a seminar. At about the mid-point of the semester, students will split into groups of 2-4 (depending on class size). Each group will select an ethnographic/demographic/economic monograph on traditional agriculture from a list provided by the instructor, prepare and present a PowerPoint presentation on it, and lead an extended classroom discussion of it. Each presentation ought to take up at least two or three class periods. The course grade will be based on the presentation and on general seminar participation (approximately 80 percent presentation and 20 percent participation, including doing the required readings). This course should appeal to graduate students and advanced undergraduates in anthropology, geography, crop and soil science, demography, rural sociology, agricultural economics, and behavioral ecology.","3 Credits"

ANTH (SOC) 579 Spatial Demography (3)The improved application of spatial data and methods to demographic research is a critical methodological challenge facing demographers today. This graduate seminar is designed to focus on substantive demographic research topics while exposing sociologists and demographers to challenges in, and opportunities for, using geographic information systems (GIS), spatial analysis, and spatial statistics in their own research. Substantive foci will include readings and discussions of spatial perspectives on topics such as racial/ethnic segregation, spatial mismatch/entrapment, poverty, crime/delinquency, migration, health inequalities, wellbeing, maternal and child health, environmental justice, and population and environment relations. Similarly, the seminar will highlight connections between spatial concepts and data availability (e.g., Modifiable Areal Unit Problem - MAUP; data privacy), other emerging methodological approaches to studying society (e.g., contextual modeling, multi-level modeling and the area of neighborhood effects) as well as the integration of different types of data (e.g. qualitative data and quantitative data). Throughout the course lectures and discussions will be complemented with lab sessions introducing spatial analysis methods and GIS and spatial analysis software. The lab sessions will include the use of among other software GeoDa, CrimeStat, R, and ArcGIS (including Geostatistical Analyst and Spatial Analyst extensions). These lab sessions will introduce many methodological and technical issues relevant to spatial analysis (e.g., error, data validation, data integration, cartography, exploratory spatial data analysis, spatial regression modeling, geographically weighted regression, point pattern analysis and geostatistics). Assignments for the courses include up to two writing assignments, up to four lab assignments, and a final project which will be presented as a short 15-minute presentation as well as submitted as a term paper. The writing assignments will include an annotated bibliography/brief literature review within a selected demographic theme area and a profile of a well-known demographer and their adoption of spatial thinking/perspectives/methods. The lab assignments will focus on building geospatial databases, basic spatial analysis, exploratory spatial data analysis, and spatial regression modeling. The courses will include other labs and assignements that will be completed for no grade; these are inteded as mechanisms/opportunities for developing and enhancing familiarity with selected software, data resources, and analytic methods.","3 Credits"

The scope of the course content is broad, rather than in-depth, covering central disciplinary concepts and associated key theoretical ideas and empirical population trends. In particular the course investigates topics such as population growth, transitions in family patterns, fertility patterns and policy, immigration and growing population diversity, race and ethnic population inequality, internal migration and residential segregation, health and mortality patterns, population aging, and economic well-being and the environment.Building on insights from the study of the above topics, students conduct a comparative population analysis of a developed vs. developing country or of two regionally dispersed U.S. states using census and vital statistics demographic data to document five or more key over-time population trends. Results from this analysis are then used to address applied demography questions about the relationships with outcomes for either business demography or public policy demography.Students will learn fundamental disciplinary concepts, central theoretical scholarship ideas, major empirical U.S. and world population trends, and experience a hands-on skill-enhancing population data analysis project which integrates knowledge and application learning.","3 Credits"
"Applied Demography (APDEM)","APDEM 802","Data, GIS, and Applied Demography","This course provides an overview of key demographic data sets, and promotes familiarity with, and appropriate use of, these data. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the wide variety of different government (and commercial) data sets that are among the most frequently utilized by practicing applied demographers. While US data sets are emphasized throughout the course international data products also will be discussed. Raw population data needed for demographic research comes from a variety of sources. The course will introduce students to the fundamental principles and design considerations of the different types of data collection systems that are used: censuses, 'rolling' censuses, surveys, vital statistics and administrative records. While contemporary issues are often studied using the latest available data many demographic questions necessitate the inclusion of a historical perspective (e.g., studies of population change) and as such linking and analyzing data across time also will be discussed. The analytical sections of the course will focus on the strengths and limitations of data products (e.g., including issues of data reliability and appropriate data use). A review and discussion of future directions in data collection and data sources wraps up the course. Enormous amounts of demographic data are now made available in aggregate form for geographical units (neighborhoods, cities, counties, states). These aggregate data are of interest in their own right but also are increasingly relevant to questions related to the role of geographic context on individual-level demographic outcomes. In this course students will learn about nested and non-nested geographical hierarchies of different data products and fundamental principles for handling and analyzing geospatial demographic data (e.g., how and when data sets can be linked together, how to visualize demographic data, spatial coverage, the influence of scale, and how to detect, and the consequences of, spatial dependence).  This is a hands-on applied course in which students will be expected to access, understand, manage, and analyze different kinds of demographic data sets.

Part 2 focuses on the impact of cohort population change for elementary, secondary, and college educational system planning. Understanding school enrollment population projection techniques is fundamental in this area of applied demography. Part 3 examines the demographic dynamics of agency client populations and within-organization work force size and characteristics. Worker population entry, turnover, and the flow of individuals through public sector and non-profit organization workplaces are topics of interest. Part 4 focuses on population data and trends that are the bases for apportionment of governmental representation among areas and population groups. Redistricting area populations for voting equity is an important local, state, national, and international applied demography issue. Part 5 examines the interface between area population characteristics and change and compliance with local, state, and national non-discrimination policy regulations related to public program activities, such as law enforcement, school administration, etc. This course covers a diverse set of topics related to public sector, non-profit, and public policy organizational activities. It provides students with a substantive understanding of key applied demography issues of interest to public sector administrators and governing boards. The course concludes with a consideration of possible newly emerging applied public sector demography issues and future public data challenges and opportunities.","3 Credits"
"Applied Demography (APDEM)","APDEM 806","Applied Demography & Health","This course provides an overview of data, methods, and techniques in applied demography used to help address public health questions. This course provides a wide-ranging coverage of substantive health questions that draw upon data and analytical methods closely associated with applied demography. The course opens with an overview of the substantive connections between health and applied demography. The remainder of the course is divided up into three main parts: (1) Local/Regional Health Assessments; (2) Methods and Case Studies in Morbidity and Mortality; and (3) Emergent Trends in Applied Demography and Health. Part 1 focuses on data needs and commonly used methods (and their limitations) related to local/regional community health assessments - including diverse contexts (rural-urban, developed and developing countries). These data and methods are utilized to examine health disparities, health service planning (based on catchment area analysis and location-allocation modeling as well as methods for measuring accessibility and utilization of health services), environmental pollution, and emergency/disaster response. Part 2 covers the connections between demographics and the epidemiological transition. This section includes a broad focus on a specific classification of human health and disease (i.e., provisioning care and disease prevention, communicable disease, non-communicable disease, and accidents and other causes of injury and death). Across each classification of health and disease the heterogeneity of data needs, time scales, spatial scales, and population at risk is wide. Applications of methods and use of case studies will facilitate the discussion of these different kinds of contemporary health challenges. Part 3 focuses briefly on the future, including an examination of global health questions (broad processes and forecasts associated with migration, urbanization, and environmental change) and new types of data and methods (including challenges and opportunities) that applied demographers will likely use in the next decade. This course covers a diverse set of topics related to human health. Some of the most important health problems of the early 21st Century (in the U.S. and globally) relate to health inequalities in access to resources (e.g., access/use of health services) and in the variation in individual exposure to risks (e.g., environmental pollution, neighborhood deprivation, obesogenic environments, and crime), and how both access to resources and exposure to risk are associated with health disparities across populations (by race, socioeconomic status, gender, age, and other forms of social stratification). This course will provide students with an understanding of key health topics, and specific data and analytical tools that can be used to address them.","3 Credits"
"Applied Demography (APDEM)","APDEM 807","Small Area Estimation","This course provides an overview of applications in small areas population estimation techniques used in public policy, business and academia, including case studies from the United States and other international programs. In particular, the course considers the growing needs of the public and private sector and non-profit organization to produce and disseminate quality disaggregated data on population that support public policy programming and business planning.  It considers small area data sources and different methodological approaches to small area estimation. Building from relevant policy examples, students will conduct a review of classical design-base approaches and apply indirect and inference techniques using auxiliary information. Students will recognize, identify and apply, with diverse types of demographic and socio-economic data, small area estimation methods, using open source and/or available software. From these insights, students will also compare case studies based on data disaggregation and Big Data Analytics.","3 Credits"

"Applied Linguistics (APLNG)","APLNG 530","Perspectives on African Language Research in the Global South","The innovations and challenges of the Global South extend beyond an agenda that redresses exclusions. Rather, these are deep-seated challenges to the core tenets of language research as well as new directions for theories and practices on language research in the Global South in general. A renewal of southern epistemologies requires an understanding of the absences such knowledge implies. To engage with the transformative potential of non-Eurocentric thinking, the course explores the relevance of a decolonial imagination that makes it possible to envisage an alternative reality and justice that engenders""radical hope."" Topics central to the course are the decolonization of research methods, feministic perspectives on African languages, Southern Multilingualisms and education, digitization of African cultural practices, indigeneity, an engagement with ""Indigenous cosmovisions,"" and reinvented traditional concepts, such as ubuntu or sumac kawsay, that suggest that the formation of other worlds is feasible. These newly reinvented cosmovisions render it feasible to move beyond the limitations of Western-centric politics and knowledge production. The course is far more than a critique of the Global North's scholarship. It will cultivate a decolonial imagination, consequently producing African language knowledge with the South, and not on the South.","3 Credits"

English now features multiple grammatical systems and norms in diverse speech communities, adopts new modes of literacy and discourse practices, and enters into fluid relationships with other languages and cultures. These changes call for a reconceptualization of language standards, linguistic identities, literacy practices, and English language teaching. After studying the historical and geopolitical bases for the rise of English, the course explores the implications of contemporary forms of transnational relations, digital technology, and popular culture for diversifying the structure, norms, and usage of the English language. The course aims to develop in students a sensitivity to the changing norms in English, provide pedagogical resources for teaching English according to local repertoires, examine strategies for facilitating intercultural communication, and articulate policies on the role of English in a multilingual world. While students specializing in teaching English as a second language (TESL) will find this course useful to inform their teaching of English worldwide, doctoral candidates in applied linguistics will find it important to understand how the plural norms of English invite new research on issues such as language acquisition, discourse analysis, and sociolinguistic identities. The course will be of interest to students of English who are increasingly interested in the way World Englishes affect multilingual creative writing and composition practices.

A conventional energy supply mix for building (grid electricity, site fossil fuel heating) results in approximately 50% primary fuel energy utilization. Advances in scalable, low emissions, electric power generating devices are leading to incorporating on-site power production into the building design. The ""waste heat"" general is of such a quality that it can be utilized at the site in heating, hot water, absorption cooling, and dehumidification applications. The simultaneous utilization of a primary fuel to generate both the electrical and thermal components in Building Combined Heat and Power (BCHP) can result in total primary fuel utilization values of 85% or greater, electric power reliability increases and significantly reduced emissions, particularly greenhouse gases. This course examines the underlying thermodynamic principles involved in BCHP, pollutant and greenhouse emission mechanisms and levels associated with both Separate Heat and Power (SHP) and BCHP designs for a given building site. Economic and regulatory principles that govern the application feasibility of a BCHP design for a given building configuration are examined. At the end of the course, students will have the skills and tools necessary to perform an assessment of the feasibility of a BCHP application to a given building site. Specific combinations of distributed, electric power generation equipment (micro-turbines, fuel cells, diesel engines, wind-power) and thermal ""waste"" utilization from these generating systems will be discussed and analyzed. Case studies are utilized to illustrate the evaluation processes. Using the SHP design methods and principles (ducted air supply systems, hydronic heating and cooling systems, etc.) covered inAE 454(Advanced HVAC) and central system methods covered inAE 557(Centralized Cooling Production and Distribution Systems) orAE 558(Centralized Heating Production and Distribution Systems) for commercial buildings, students will learn how to achieve and establish the same building performance objectives using Combined Heat and Power (CHP) technologies.

"Architecture (ARCH)","ARCH 501","Analysis of Architectural Precedents: Ancient Industrial Revolution","Analysis of architectural precendents from antiquity to the turn of the twentieth century through methodologies emphasizing research and critical inquiry. The 20th century Italian architectural historian and theorist Manfredo Tafuri argued that architecture was intrinsically forward-looking and utopian: ""project"" in both the sense of ""a design project"" and a leap into the future, like ""projectile"" or ""projection."" However, he also argued that architectural history, understood deeply and critically, is indispensible if that leap is to make the world a better place. For any new building to make a positive and meaningful contribution to the physical and human world, architects must not only know what they can build, but what has been built, and what architecture's positive and negative impact has been in the past. This course will introduce the history of architecture from antiquity to the turn of the 20th century through (1) ten selected buildings, one covered each week, and (2) a methodology emphasizing research and critical inquiry.

What is ""modern"" architecture? What conditions gave rise to the various movements that have come to dominate design since the industrial revolution? What sort of design did these theoretical works and movements produce, and how did it contribute to architecture's development? An understanding of modernism and its legacy is crucial to a thorough understanding of the architectural culture of the 21st century. By examining buildings from early modernism to today, this course will introduce the theory of modern architecture from its multiple, disputed points of origin through the late twentieth century. Our operative term will be modernisms, in the plural. ""Modernism"" is a convenient and important label, but its suggestion of unity can camouflage the complexity of a phenomenon that spans decades, cultures, continents, and ideas.","3 Credits"

"Architecture (ARCH)","ARCH 504","Materials and Building Construction II","Continuing examination of fundamentals and advanced building materials, systems and construction technologies associated with their architectural use.ARCH 504Materials and Building Construction II (3) This first-year graduate seminar course will continue to present students with information on fundamental and advanced building materials and systems and on construction technologies associated with their architectural use. Students will also consider the advancements in architectural materials and technologies. It is the second part of a two-semester sequence preceded byARCH 503. Recurrent course themes include 1) architecture as a product of culture (wisdom, abilities, aspirations), 2) architecture as a product of place (materials, tools, topography, climate), the relationship between architectural appearance presented and the mode of construction employed, 3) materials and making as an expression of an idea and 4) the relationship of a building whole to a detail. This course is motivated by these concerns: a firm belief that architects must know and engage the age they are living in, so as to design and represent it with extreme appropriateness. The course explicitly addresses engagement with society/culture and its appropriate representation by asking students to form opinions about the architectural potential of contemporary and emerging technologies. Their opinions are informed by the presentation of architectural materials and associated construction methods as they evolved - contextualized by human history and by their application in the built environment. In this class students are seeing the material and technological means of making architecture continuously altered by shifting human cultural desires and artistic/scientific/industrial developments. They are simultaneously receiving instruction in their application and use. Through assignments, students also work directly with materials at full scale and learn to represent construction systems through the conventions of drawing and modeling.","3 Credits"

Evaluation of central texts, methods, theories, and outcomes.ARCH 512Critical Theory in Architecture (6)ARCH 512is composed of six chronologically arranged units of study that examine the major developments in the evolution of discursive practices that ground architecture theory, teaching, and practice. Modern and post-Modern critical theories in architecture have borrowed from a number of tangent disciplines, such as Phenomenology, Positivism, Existentialism, Narratology, Structuralism, Deconstruction, Grounded Theory (social sciences), Cognitive-Behaviorism, Neo-Kantianism, Psychoanalysis, Reception Theory, etc. Historical methodology, Archaeology, Anthropology Art History, and other disciplines have also had their impact. As a result, critical theory in architecture typically lacks uniform methodologies and stable definitions. In recent years, many disciplines have undergone attempts to consolidate discourse around the influence of language and culture within the historical context of evolving world ideologies and their effect on communication, material culture, and the physical environment. Architecture has responded to this general trend in a number of ways that invite cross-disciplinary comparisons and methodological adaptations. The course will take advantage of featuring visiting scholars whose expertise in diverse areas of study will provide participants with direct contact with the widest possible range of theoretical perspectives. The strategy of the course will be a comparison and critical evaluation of what appear to be the most effective research methods within the pressing concerns of environment, population growth, material resource depletion , and international conflict. The aim will be to establish relevance as well as research competence and effective expression.","6 Credits"

The major means of accomplishing this is through the design of simple buildings and environments. The semester is divided into two halves: The first half of the semester focuses on fundamental and abstract principles of architectural design, and the theory associated with design principles. It covers architectural fundamentals such as drawing and making models through a series of abstract exercises, and introduces the principles and methods used at various stages of design analysis and synthesis processes. The second half of the semester makes a transition from abstract principles to fundamental architectural design principles such as function, scale, and structure to concepts of space and form, as they pertain to small scale design projects.

"Art Education (AED)","AED 523","Transdisciplinary Creativity: Eco-social Justice Art","Transdisciplinary creativity develops new knowledge, metaphors, visualizations, and insights through performative renderings from dialogue, collaboration, exploration, and experimentation. Transdisciplinary creativity is the coming together of two or more disciplines in order to create something more than the individual or the community by recognizing, combining, and utilizing knowledges of all participants. Moreover, transdisciplinary creativity is a social process that develops sense-abilities. Sense-ability is the capacity to attend to the sensory and sensation, as a collective affective awareness of the environment. Students in the course will explore how different methodologies enhance understanding of complex issues such as sustainability, climate change, climate diaspora, environmental racism, and resource depletion. The national and international scope of environmental conversations is forging alliances across disciplines around urgent matters such as climate change. Rather than STEAM being used as an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics, STEAM is explored, in this course, in terms of collectives such as EcoArtTech, in which their work is eco-social justice action to create STEAM. Moreover, STEAM is considered as transdisciplinary creativity for eco-social justice. From a transdisciplinary view of STEAM, works of art are not an appendage or a singular discourse. STEAM is a transdisciplinary approach to environmental issues. STEAM as an action emphasizes ecology, transdisciplinary research, and creativity as a social process.","3 Credits"

Although art educators were identifying policy needs and submitting resolutions with policy recommendations to national agencies during the interwar years, arts education policy gained importance during the 1960s with the founding of The National Endowments for the Humanities and Arts. Arts education ""as opposed to art, dance, music, or theatre education"" is a political construct forged in order to successfully advocate for inclusion of visual and performing arts in National Educational Goals during the late twentieth century. In this course, students will explore what counts as policy for arts education and how policy discourse is framed; who constitutes stakeholders and policy makers; contexts where policy is advocated and created; and how advocates develop and communicate proposals for needed policies. Working in small groups, students will examine recent issues related to arts education policy, presenting those issues in class.","3 Credits"
"Art Education (AED)","AED 525","Including Difference","Disability is normal. Ableness is temporary. However, social stigmas, misunderstandings, and notions of ""normal"" exclude students and adults with disabilities. How have artists with disabilities offered worldviews that decenter normal? To pursue decentering normal, students in the course explore the creative practice of contemporary artists labeled by society as disabled to understand how their viscerally empowered art can function pedagogically to decenter notions of normal. Decentering notions of normal begins with identifying and challenging social systems that-through visual, lingual, and technological cues-communicate which traits are considered normal and which are not. While the analysis of linguistic and visual representations is instructive for articulating identity construction and its relationship to power and privilege, these lines of inquiry within disability studies overlook the realities of embodied difference that are a part of many people who live with disabilities. Notions of a normalized body frame certain patterns of behavior, cognition, affect, and physicality from which bodies are measured as either within or outside of the frame of normalized learning spaces such as schools. The Feminist Disability Studies and Disability Justice readings in the course go beyond labeling difference and invest in articulating and understanding difference as interconnected relationships in which inclusion may be fostered.","3 Credits"

This is the focus of this course. Course participants have the opportunity to explore the aesthetic communicative and pedagogical implications of intertextual Webs, hypertext and hypermedia, blogs, wikis, simulations, the body interfaced in virtual reality, threaded dialogue, WebQuests, online games, media communities, adaptive and assistive technologies, and media-rich essays. Learning activities will be in the form of explorations and creation with the links and resources provided, and focused discussions about these explorations and how to teach this content at participants' teaching sites. Following 5 thematic explorations, course participants write a capstone essay to construct a speculative fiction of a teaching scenario based on the content of the course imagined in a future teaching site. The main priorities in Exploration 1 are to imagine possibilities of human-technology interfaces for creating and critiquing art. In Exploration 2, participants select a social networking tool from the course's resources to conduct a collaborative mini-project concerning self-representation online and power relational networks of social, physical, technological, and discursive inscriptions or conditions. Exploration 3, involves using the Internet as a primary medium for art creation and involves developing criteria to critique interactive Net art. The focus of Exploration 4 is free, downloadable authoring programs outside of a commercial economy, which enables the creation of interactive experiences without the need for specialized programming knowledge or database support. Exploration 5 involves participants creating a socially responsive visual culture WebQuest, which is an inquiry-oriented activity in which learners construct knowledge through interacting with, evaluating, and connecting diverse, and sometimes contradictory, resources on the Internet in order to form new insights that they share in a tangible form intended to make a difference in the world.

Diversity pertains to gender, sexual identity, social class, ethnicity, ability, age, and other attributes that shape our identities. This course pays special attention to issues of power and privilege in relation to diversity and visual culture. It examines ways that various forms of visual culture, situated in various social contexts, teach us who we are, what is ""normal"" in our society, and how we might change oppressive social conditions that currently exist. As defined in the course, visual culture includes paintings, sculptures, prints, and other forms of fine art as well as advertisements, news images, scientific images, television programs, and films. It includes toys, comic books, children's art and more. Visual culture includes all manifestations of cultural life that are significant for their visual features. Pedagogy refers not only to formal methods of instruction, such as teaching and learning in classrooms. It also includes informal instruction through the arts, the media, popular forms of entertainment, and other social practices. Pedagogy includes being positioned by, or addressed in certain ways by various forms of visual culture. It includes the ways we actively interpret, use, and recreate forms of visual culture in our lives. Objectives of the course include understanding diversity as defined in relation to various forms of visual culture; understanding the complex interactions of ethnicity, class, gender, sexual identity, and other aspects of diversity in visual culture; understanding issues of power and privilege in relation to visual culture; and understanding pedagogical issues related to visual culture, including forms of address and interpretation, as well as pedagogical practices such as teaching and learning in classrooms. By the end of the course, participants should be able to critically examine social constructions of race, class, gender, sexual identity, and other aspects of diversity in visual culture through both written and visual analyses. Participants should also be able to develop and implement units of instruction related to visual culture, and reflect on their own and others' teaching practices in schools and museums.This is one of the required courses for the M.P.S. in Art Education.

As defined in the course, critical public pedagogy of art, as an educational and artistic practice, is a critical stance concerning socio-pervasive artifacts, processes, and interfaces that acculturate and assimilate values, beliefs, and sensitivities.Public pedagogy is the use of a public medium and/or space such as the Internet, films, television, magazines, shopping malls, and sports arenas to influence behaviors and beliefs. Public pedagogy enacts societal curricula that are easily consumed because of its ubiquitous nature. Awareness of consumption of public pedagogy is important because of its global reach. Educators need to be versed in how to facilitate investigations of public pedagogy and how to guide students to develop critical public pedagogical practices. From spheres of influence radiating from art to a multidirectional layered matrix of sensibility, this course explores contemporary art that addresses and enacts public pedagogy through (inter)actions of cultural interfaces such as humans, technologies, localities, and politics. Such artworks are performed networks of relations. Contemporary artists' praxis involving intertextuality, palimpsest, remix, code-switching,double-coding, subversion, and hypersignification is explored through video, installation, performance, and other contemporary art forms. Objectives of the course include understanding processes of consumption and production of public pedagogy, and understanding contemporary art practices. By the end of the course, participants should be able to develop and implement units of instruction related to contemporary art and public pedagogy, and reflect on their own and others' teaching practices in schools and museums.This is one of the required courses for the M.P.S. in Art Education.

In the academic world, and particularly in the humanities, the publication of articles and books is understood to be a marker of success and, along with teaching skills, the basis on which appointments are made and tenure granted. Essential to this body of production is the execution and placement of one's research undertakings, skills that the ""Methods Seminar"" is designed to hone. No less valued by those who make appointments and offer promotion are the grants and fellowships that a candidate has won. Indeed, since research in art history involves travel to and residence at museum, library and archive sites- whether these be in North America or abroad-financial support is a necessity for most aspiring professionals and is regarded as evidence of external validation of their investigations. Training in ""grant writing"" is also covered in the seminar. Even before field work is undertaken, the investigator must be aware of the ""state of research,"" work normally undertaken at one's own university library. In this domain there are better and worse ways of taking notes. The seminar discusses these methods and goes beyond them to consider the optimum means by which such records are organized and assembled prior to the delivery of papers and the production of articles. The nature of an oral presentation and a publishable paper are distinct activities and this difference needs to be learned. The more complex skills involved in the writing of articles, the securing of photographs and concomitant permissions, and the choice of the journal to which the ""finished"" piece should be submitted are dealt with at even greater length.","3 Credits"

The challenge is that we are in an uncharted ethical territory with regard to AI: we need to radically adjust our existing ethical paradigms or introduce new ones as we experience and acquire a better grasp of the problems involved in AI-human interaction. A large portion of these issues reflect our concerns about the harm that the use and misuse of AI might cause for humanity. Such issues range from threats to individual privacy and freedom to wider social implications regarding economic justice and race and gender equality. However, as AI systems develop and attain higher levels of intelligence, questions about their moral status become more pressing. If these systems are capable of moral agency, then not only do they have responsibilities towards other moral agents like us, but they also have rights that we should respect in our conduct towards them. This course offers an overview of the nature and extent of the ethical issues arising from AI-human interaction as well as the philosophical background (particularly, in ethics and philosophy of mind) required to develop an informed methodology in approaching these issues, with the help of the flourishing literature on the subject.","3 Credits"

"Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASTRO)","ASTRO 515","Astrostatistics","Modern astronomical research -- the study of planets, stars, galaxies and the Universe -- and the linking of observational data to astrophysical theory encounter a wide array of challenges falling under the rubric of statistical inference. Cosmology, for example, addresses spatial clustering of galaxies, nonlinear regression of Big Bang astrophysical models, supervised regression of galaxy photometric redshifts, multiple hypothesis tests for faint source detection in images, multivariate classification, and time series analysis of billion-object multi-epoch surveys. Big Data arising from large-scale astronomical surveys and Bayesian modeling of astrophysical models are propelling astrostatistics into greater importance than in the past. Yet the curriculum for young astronomers typically includes no courses in statistical methodology. This course is designed to fill this gap. The course progresses through three stages. First, basic principles in statistical inference are presented and discussed including elements of probability theory, point and interval estimation, and probability distributions. The techniques of least squares, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference are outlined here and exercised later in the course. Second, central fields of applied statistics are investigated including nonparametric statistics and density estimation, regression (including nonlinear models from astrophysical theory), and multivariate analysis (including unsupervised clustering and supervised classification). Specific statistical methods are linked to specific astronomical problems at each step. Third, the instructor and students choose topics for study, such as time series analysis, spatial point processes, censoring and truncation, Bayesian computation, and scientific visualization. Common characteristics of astronomical data that are not treated in standard statistical presentations are discussed in detail, including heteroscedastic measurement errors, irregularly-spaced time series, and nonlinear astrophysical models. A crucial element of the course is practical training in the implementation of these statistical methods using sophisticated public-domain software environments. Software tutorials in class and text help educate the student to a level where data and science analysis can proceed at a mature level.","3 Credits"

"Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASTRO)","ASTRO 801","Planets, Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe","Overview of the structure, formation, and evolution of planets, stars, galaxies, and the universe. Topic: Observations by modem ground-based and space-based observatories have fueled significant changes in our understanding of the Universe. The Solar System contains only 8 planets but has many thousands of Kuiper Belt Objects, including Pluto. Large area sky surveys have taken inventory of the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and galaxies in the Universe and determined that only 4% of the mass of the universe is found in luminous objects. Besides the mysterious ""dark matter,"" we now know that the energy budget of the universe is dominated by ""dark energy,"" which is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate. ASTRO 80 I: Planets, Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe will provide science educators with a strong foundation in astronomy, allowing them to critically evaluate the evidence for the most recent advances in our understanding of the Solar System, our Galaxy, and the Universe.  Astronomers use observations of the light from distant sources to discover the nature of these objects and their environment.ASTRO 801will lead students to an understanding of light and the instruments for its detection. They will see how careful analysis of these observational data and theoretical models are used to solve the mysteries of the Universe.ASTRO 801will combine digital video, audio, simulation models, and the wealth of astronomical imagery from NASA's Hubble, Chandra, and Spitzer Great Observatories.

This course will focus on evolution of protein-coding sequences, conformations and functions of proteins. Different species show varying characteristics of structure, metabolism, and regulatory control networks. Most of these differences are the product of the evolution of protein-coding sequences. DNA mutations can change amino acid sequences, protein structures and protein functions; and favorable mutations are selected, in ways that are integrated to form an organism adapted at both macroscopic and molecular levels. The availability of large databanks of protein amino acid sequences, and protein three-dimensional structures, and the annotation of protein function in the entries in these databanks, has allowed investigation of evolutionary changes that impact proteins. One of the goals of the course will be to describe these databanks and the computational tools available to apply them in research in molecular biology. Many students will find these tools useful in their own research projects. The evolutionary divergence of proteins has shown several types ofeffects. In some cases, related proteins in different species retain similar functions, but show differences in amino acid sequence and structure. The nature of observed changes in sequence and structure will be described and the relationship between sequence changes and structural changes examined in several well-documented examples, including globins, and serine proteases. In some cases, proteins diverge within a single species to form large families of related molecules with specialized functions. For example, the human genome encodes hundreds of odorant receptors. The comparison of related proteins that have adopted novel functions reveals how cells can expand their functional repertoire. In most cases it is easier to adapt an existing structure to a new function than to create a new protein ""from scratch"". For example, the proteolytic enzymes of the chymotrypsin family are related to haptoglobin, an iron scavenger that has lost its enzymatic activity. Beyond the description of individual proteins and individual protein families, there is the more general question of how changes in functions of individual proteins are integrated to create a smoothly-running cellular ""operating system"". The evolution of sequences encoding regulatory proteins to achieve this will be discussed. Methods of bioinformatics to address these questions will bepresented, with emphasis on study and comparison of structures with computer graphics.","2 Credits"

International studies have repeatedly confirmed that people (Chinese, Japanese) migrate from their country of origin to the U.S., adopt the pattern of certain cancers within a few generations (e.g., breast and prostate) of the latter country, which is indicative of the presence of chemical carcinogens in the environment and/or changes in lifestyles. Consequently, the search for carcinogens that exist in the human environment challenges both scientists and regulatory agencies. Chronic exposure to traces of chemical carcinogens in the diet, in polluted air, or in tobacco smoke can be important in the etiology of several human cancers in the presence of host factors that favor the multi-step process of carcinogenesis. Bioassays in laboratory animals can provide important information on the role of environmental agents in the induction of particular types of cancer. Biochemical studies can lead to insights into the nature of interactions of these environmental agents with macromolecules such as DNA that are necessary, but not always sufficient for carcinogenesis.The search for optimal diets and for naturally occurring agents in routinely consumed foods that may inhibit cancer development, although challenging, constitutes a valuable and plausible approach to finding ways to control and prevent cancer. The prevention of cancer is the longstanding goal for most cancer researchers. There has been enormous gain in our understanding of carcinogenesis and cancer progression; such knowledge has provided new and promising opportunities to prevent cancer, e.g., to treat pre-cancer or inhibit carcinogenesis (a process often involving 20-30 years in human epithelial cancers), rather than waiting to treat cancer. In the early 1980's, the U.S. National Cancer Institute recognized the promise of chemoprevention research. In summary, this course will provide a better understanding of the potential contribution of environmental carcinogens in the development of certain human cancers and will provide important information on cancer chemoprevention intervention strategies.The co ruse will cover topics that include exposure, metabolic activation, detoxification, and biomonitoring of chemical carcinogens in the human environment, carcinogen-induced DNA damage, mutagenesis and DNA repair, carcinogen-induced cellular and molecular alternations, tumorigenesis and organ specificity in laboratory animals, and factors modulating individual susceptibility to the deleterious effects on chemical carcinogens. Furthermore, this course will provide knowledge on various classes of cancer chemopreventive agents, their efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action in preclinical studies.Course Objectives: Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to: 1. Understand the potential risk associated with human exposure to chemical carcinogens detected in the environment. 2. Describe the current assays of biomonitoring of human exposure to chemical carcinogens. 3. Learn the process of metabolic activation and detoxification of chemical carcinogens. 4. Understand the stages of the multi-step carcinogenesis process. 5. Identify factors that govern individual susceptibility to the deleterious effects of chemical carcinogens. 6. Understand the concept of cancer chemoprevention. 7. Identify molecular and cellular targets for chemoprevention intervention at any time during the process of carcinogenesis.Grading: Grading will be determined as follows: 1. Midterm Exam 30% 2. Research Paper* 30% 3. Class Participation 10% 4. Final Exam 30% Total 100%*Guidelines for Research Paper: The topic will be selected following approval of the faculty member in charge. The paper should include the goals (aims) of the research project, literature background, the significance of the research topic, knowledge to be gained, gaps in existing knowledge, and the potential to propose future studies.

Untitled DocumentBIOL 519Ecological and Environmental Problem Solving (4) The course will provide a general overview of the process involved in studying a variety of ecological and environmental problems. It will provide a toolbox of techniques for understanding ecological and environmental problems, and discuss how they can be used to address questions and generate testable predictions. It will examine connections between individuals and populations and communities as well as between theory and data. The focus will be on theoretical and computer modeling approaches, while maintaining a strong link to data and real systems.After an introduction to modeling, students will learn to develop and use simple and stochastic optimization models for individual organisms, as well as applying basic game theory to interactions between individuals. Many of the class meetings will be held in computer laboratories where they will be actively engaged in working on applying these models. They will explore a sequence of population demographic models of increasing complexity, ranging from unlimited unstructured population growth to density-dependent, structured population growth, in non-spatial and spatial contexts, culminating an individual-based models for population dynamics. The students will then apply these models to interacting species, learning about mutualistic, competitive and host-natural enemy interactions. Finally, we will explore theory for communities of species in space and time. Applied problems will be drawn from all areas of conservation, harvesting, pest control and epidemiology.Graduate students will additionally be required to attend a once a week case study, where we will focus on a paper from the recent literature that uses the techniques or theory learned that week in class. Additionally, graduates will develop models of their own, based on their own research, or on some other subject of interest. They will be expected to meet with me twice in a group and individually during office hours throughout the semester, to discuss the development of their projects. They will have to complete a written report on the motivation, model development, and results and implications of their work. This work will take the form of a short manuscript (as if for publication to a representative journal in their field).

"Biology (BIOL)","BIOL 559","Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species","Each week will be dedicated to one chapter of the first edition (1859) of Charles Darwin's masterpiece On the Origin of Species. Each chapter is divided by Darwin himself in a series of sections (usually about 10 sections per chapter). Each chapter will be commented on through an open discussion which will proceed section by section. The main goal of the open discussion will be to extract from each section the main argument(s) presented by Darwin. During the open discussion, the instructor will give students an overview of the historical background: ideas and knowledge at the time; each person cited by Darwin will be commented on; Darwin also sometimes refers to other people's findings or ideas without citing their names, and those will be revealed and commented on too. We will critically discuss the data that Darwin mentions, whether they are from his own observations or not. We will also pay special attention to his writing style (vocabulary, repetitions, etc.) which is very precise. Occasionally, changes that Darwin made in the later editions will also be highlighted (using the variorum edition). At the end of this course, students will be able to use a rigorous method to critically study any important work in history of science (by putting any text within its own historical, cultural, and scientific context). The students will understand in depth Darwin's remarkable achievement in On the Origin of Species, which will allow them to take it back to their classrooms with undergraduate students as well as apply it to their own research. Students will be able to make direct connections between Darwin's masterpiece and modern biology because Darwin touched upon many of the questions that we are still struggling with. After this course, students will be able to realize that vocabulary, rhetoric, and writing style do matter, because On the Origin of Species is a masterpiece of scientific communication, and apply that to their own scientific writing.","3 Credits"

BIOL 592BIOL 592 Critical Evaluation of Literature in Biology (1)This course teaches beginning graduate students how to evaluate new findings reported in primary literature in the biological sciences. Each week, a recently published paper is evaluated according to 8 basic criteria as follows:1. Does the author adequately establish a context for the issues addressed in the paper? Are the issues addressed in the paper important in the field? Why or why not? 2. What is the hypothesis? Is it clearly stated? Is it operational (i.e. ""falsifiable"")? 3. Are the methods adequate to test the hypothesis? Why or why not? What are the controls? Are they adequate? 4. Are the data clearly presented? Are the results properly analyzed? Are statistical inferences stated appropriately? Do the data meet the assumptions of the statistical tests? 5. What conclusions are drawn from the results? Do the conclusions follow from the data? Have some conclusions been overlooked? Are there reasonable alternative interpretations of the data? Did the authors consider alternative hypotheses? 6. What could be done to improve the paper? Consider written format as well as the overall experimental design. For example, is the title appropriate? Does the abstract accurately summarize the results and conclusions? Does the paper use recent and appropriate references? 7. What is your overall opinion of the size of contribution that the paper makes to the body of knowledge in its field? Is this work creative? Does it provide new insights or a framework to understand previously disparate data? Defend your position. 8. What would be the next set of tests of the hypothesis or the next hypotheses to test? How should these hypotheses be examined experimentally? To what extent do you think this paper will stimulate further studies?The goal of the course is to provide students with opportunities to sharpen their thinking in regard to what constitutes meaningful scientific experimentation, interpretation of results, and effective presentation of information in text, figures, and tables. Near the end of the course each student prepares a written critique of a paper, and meets individually with the faculty to discuss their critique.

"Business Administration (BADM)","BADM 555","New Product Development and Management","This course will cover the concepts of new product/service development and brand management strategies for competition intensive firms. Identifying opportunities, developing strategies, and designing processes for the creation of new products are key responsibilities for both entrepreneurs and managers in established firms. But developing new products is also fraught with risk: an overwhelming majority fail when introduced to the market. This course is about improving the odds of placing winning bets on new products. This course is especially recommended to students who expect to (i) launch their own businesses, (ii) work as brand or product managers, or (iii) have responsibilities requiring knowledge of product strategies and management of new product initiatives. Consultants who advise clients on product strategies may also benefit from taking the course. Strategies and processes for new product development will be the core of the course. Strategy provides the context for product development --- without it, each product development project is a separate and disjointed effort that has a much lower chance of success. This is one major reason why so many new products fail. Strategy for new products requires aligning new product development with market opportunities (for example in emerging markets, or by exploiting new inventions and technologies); selecting business models; and choosing effective marketing and manufacturing strategies. Process includes choosing a sequence of activities that is both rational and effective for converting ideas into compelling new products. These activities include concept development, design, prototyping, demand estimation, costing and pricing, branding, packaging, product testing, and market testing. However, not all products use the same development processes, and it is important to understand when to use which processes. It is expected that students enrolling inBADM 555will be familiar with fundamental marketing concepts and practices. These are generally addressed in an undergraduate marketing course or equivalent professional training.","3 Credits/Maximum of 999"

BUSAD 545BUSAD 545 Negotiation Strategies (3) Although situations involving international incidents, corporate acquisitions, or national collective bargaining contracts demonstrate the dramatic effects of the need for negotiation, it is something that most people do every day. Negotiation is not a process reserved for skilled diplomats, top salespeople, or leaders of labor unions. The structure and processes of negotiation at the interpersonal level are fundamentally the same as at the corporate or international level. For this reason, knowledge about and skill in negotiating is essential to anyone who works with and through other people to accomplish objectives. It is part of the normal ""give and take"" of any business situation, such as negotiating salaries, arranging deals with vendors, or allocating resources for a project. Unfortunately the ability to simply recognize conflict and the need for bargaining does not insure successful negotiating situations. Negotiation is a complex human activity, involving a dynamic interpersonal process. The skilled negotiator possesses a number of skills including: the intellectual ability to understand the key facts that shape and characterize different negotiation situations; the skills to diagnose problems and select appropriate strategies and approaches to address them; and the understanding of one's own personality and value system, which affect the perception of a situation and the choice of tactics and strategy. Negotiation is a learnable process.

While studying firms in different market structures, most of the focus will be on business firms which have some market power: monopolistic competition and oligopolies (a small number of inter-dependent suppliers). Strategic behaviors of firms and different oligopoly models will be studied in detail. Business firms operate within an economic environment that provides opportunities, constraints, and threats. The second part of the course focuses on the economic environment over time, generally described as the business cycle. The course will begin considering business cycles by looking first at main indicators such as growth of real GDP (Gross Domestic Product), unemployment rates, and inflation rates. Students will employ simple models of the business cycle to explain recessions, inflation, and other environmental conditions. Financial markets are important in determining economic conditions. Students will learn about the role of financial markets in determining availability and costs of funds. Economic policy is the effort of government to change the economic environment. An important part of the course is the study of these policies. Fiscal policy consists of the use of taxation and government spending to shape the environment. Monetary policy is the effort to influence credit conditions and interest rates for the purpose of achieving a specific environmental change. Domestic economic conditions are increasingly shaped by global conditions. Therefore, a part of the course will be devoted to analysis of foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and monetary policies of other countries. In addition, students will analyze the impacts of barriers to international trade (primarily quotas, tariffs, and foreign exchange controls) and investment.","3 Credits/Maximum of 999"

Since building design is governed by the Building Code, currently, International Building Code that adopts American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) document ASCE-7 for load determination, the seismic provisions of ASCE-7 will be used as the basis for design. The course starts by introducing earthquake phenomenon and engineering seismology concepts. The basic principles of structural dynamics are then covered for single degree of freedom systems starting from free vibration to random loading so that students learn how a ground acceleration time-history subjected to the base of a building can be converted to a time varying effective seismic load on the mass. After introduction of response spectrum, introductory material on multi-degree of freedom systems is introduced so that students can determine natural frequencies and mode shapes for multi-story buildings and perform modal superposition analysis to determine displacement and force responses. Next, the principles of earthquake resisting design related to energy dissipation, ductility, over-strength, and redundancy followed by seismic provision of the building code are discussed. The main design principles related to the two main materials for building construction consisting of reinforced concrete and structural steel are next discussed. The focus will be to illustrate how lateral load resisting systems such as shear walls, moment resisting frames, or braced frames made with such materials as appropriate are designed to resist earthquake effects based on respective material code provisions, that is, American Concrete Institute (ACI) for concrete and American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) for steel.

The resulting confrontations may stem from technological innovation, real or perceived changes in the marketplace, or the imperatives of prevailing regulatory, political or economic philosophies. Conflict resolution often results from persuasive advocacy, coalition building, and accommodation of outsiders with new perspectives or entrepreneurial visions, rather than applying legal precedent or treaty interpretations.The course also will examine how various nations have organized and reorganized the telecommunications sector. We will consider such developments as privatization, liberalization, deregulation and globalization.Faculty: Rob Frieden","3 Credits"
"Communications (COMM)","COMM 585","Media & Telecommunications Industries","Study the structure and performance of media, telecommunications and information industries applying principles and ideas from microeconomics, finance and communications.COMM 585COMM 585Media & Telecommunications Industries (3) The objective of this graduate seminar is twofold. First, the course provides exposure to the applications of selected concepts, principles and topics in microeconomics to the analysis of the media, telecommunication and information markets. This course is not intended as a general introduction to microeconomic theory and practice - however, students will have the opportunity to begin their study of selected applications of microeconomic principles at a fundamental level and advance their understanding to a high level of complexity worthy of graduate coursework. The second objective of the course is to connect ideas and principles from microeconomics to a body of communications theories, demonstrating possible complements and conflicts across the two disciplines. Discussion of both theoretical and empirical scholarship is emphasized. This in turn gives students a framework for further research on the structure of information industries and the conduct and performance of communications firms. Course covers international markets but focus is on North America. Topics may include selected industries such as wired and wireless telephony, satellite communications, broadband/cable, broadcasting, film, advertising, publishing, computing and Internet; industrial organization; competition and competitive advantage, growth and the economic causes of innovation; economics of intellectual property protection; electronic markets, hierarchies and transactions cost economics; the economic justification and effects of regulation; natural monopoly economics; cost modeling, demand forecasting and pricing in regulated monopoly and competitive industries; telecommunications deregulation and privatization.","3 Credits"
"Communications (COMM)","COMM 587","Internet Law and Policy","Examination of legal, policy and business developments in Internet-mediated communications emphasizing the impact on existing regulatory and economic models.  COMM 587COMM 587 Internet Law and Policy (3) This course will provide a forum for students to investigate and debate ongoing or anticipated conflicts in Internet-mediated telecommunications, information processing and commerce. The resulting confrontations may stem from technological innovation, real or perceived changes in the marketplace, or the imperatives of prevailing regulatory, political or economic philosophies. Conflict resolution often results from persuasive advocacy, coalition building, and accommodation of outsiders with new perspectives or entrepreneurial visions, rather than applying legal precedent or treaty interpretations. Internet mediation has the potential to change how we communicate, educate, inform, entertain, and transact business. Technological and marketplace convergence means that Internet mediation will have a profound impact on many legal, regulatory and economic constructs, i.e., the pre-existing templates we use to describe and understand the communications process and impact on individuals and society. The course also will examine the growing body of cases that have addressed aspects of Internet-mediation in each of the following general categories: � Speech - commercial and political speech, obscenity, forums analysis; � Legal and Regulatory Consequences of Convergence - the juxtaposition of telecommunications and information processing technologies, markets and regulatory regimes; � Governance and regulation of the Internet - whether the need exists for government intervention on such matters as numbering and domain name registration; � Intellectual Property Rights - the impact of Internet-mediation on copyright, trademark and patent laws; � Electronic Commerce - the law and policy of Internet-mediated transactions; privacy and encryption concerns; and � Equity, Competition Policy and Consumer Protection Concerns what, if anything, should governments do to remedy market failures.","3 Credits"

R SOC (CEDEV) 516 Change in Rural Society (3) Rural America has experienced change throughout its history, but the most rapid have occurred in the past three decades. Forces of urbanization, industrialization, technological change and globalization of the economy drive change in rural America, and the effects of these forces differ across the United States. Some rural areas benefit from the changes that occur while others are devastated. Some rural people and places are able to adapt and view change as an opportunity, while others are unable to respond to the forces that threaten them. Individuals, families and communities have changed in response to these broad forces. This becomes manifest in new patterns of inequality, family life, educational attainment, migration, age and racial patterns, health and well-being, and local service availability. Questions examined in this course include: What are the theories that explain or describe the social change that has been affecting rural people and places? What industrial restructuring and economic change has occurred in rural areas, how has it affected rural areas, and what drives this restructuring? What other social change has taken place, and can we determine potential sources of that change? What are the options available to rural people and communities as they adapt to forces of change, and how much can they influence their own futures? Underlying each of these questions is the issue of whether the well-being of rural people, families, and communities has improved or is threatened by these changes, and which rural areas are most likely to benefit and which are threatened. Students will leave the class with a broad understanding of the forces affecting rural America, and how and why those forces influence some people and places differently.

Globalization impacts the development of regions and places in the United States and around the world. In this context, the development of regions impacts and is impacted by the pace and level of development elsewhere. Regional development addresses issues of how growth and disparity are spatially distributed and differentiated, and what causes these patterns to occur. The challenge is twofold. The first challenge is defining exactly what a region is and identifying who ultimately decides the policies and practices that determine its fate. The second is determining who benefits and who bares the costs of particular local and regional development approaches. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to concepts and frameworks of regional development. The first part of the course focuses on definitions and theories of regional growth and development, and begins to uncover ambiguities in pre-existing definitions and theories of regional development associated with topics such as growth and development theory, the new geography, cluster economics, and sustainability. It then delves into various policy approaches and issues including regional, environmental, and rural issues. The course culminates with a discussion of putting regional theory and policy into practice through case studies. Issues and topics addressed in this course include identifying a region and defining 'place'; understanding the relationship between economic efficiency and sustainability; sustainable development and place-based development; the use of policy and its framing to allow regions and places to build on their assets. Additionally, the course will address how regions become interdependent and how relationships can be optimized in this context, and determining the best way and available sources to garner capital to fund development projects. Students will learn how to identify the assets of a region and the impact of interregional collaboration. The course will provide students with the opportunity to analyze the politics of regional development and the important considerations in regional development planning and practice.","3 Credits"

"Comparative and International Education (CIED)","CIED 516","Education and Demographic Change","Education is one of the most important factors affecting major demographic shifts and processes worldwide, including the first and second demographic transitions. If, as the old sociological adage goes ""demography is destiny,"" then our destiny is educationally transformed demography.  Interdisciplinary research across demography, sociology, neuropsychology, and epidemiology is developing a strong research literature about how the thinking style, behavior, and attitudes of the educated human radically change fundamental dynamics underlying the world's population. The whole way in which we come to our jobs, spouses, and lifestyles; how many children we have and how we raise them; how long we are likely to live, and what will be our eventual demise are all heavily influenced by how much education we have had. The collective force of widespread education and its influence on rising cognitive abilities, scripts for living, and economic well-being are creating a distinctly new type of human population with major benefits and future challenges for a sustainable human population.  At the same time, individuals' schooling is also influenced by demographic change. This seminar covers key concepts, theories, and methodological issues related to the intersection of demographical and cultural changes from the education revolution and their impact on subsequent demographic processes.","3 Credits"

We will investigate the range of global literatures and consider the term ""world literature"" in two senses: (a) discerning the theories and meanings inherent in the concept and (b) charting the scope of a world of literature that can fit into one semester within specific institutional expectations. We will discuss the challenges and opportunities inherent in teaching works that are written in a variety of languages, come from a wide range of temporal periods and diverse cultural settings, reflect or provide alternatives to international canons, rely upon varying assumptions and ideologies, and demonstrate different relations to translation, literacy, visuality, orality, and performance. Students will become acquainted with aspects of learning theory and research questions as well as with professional resources such as conferences and journals in this field. We will theorize and explore concrete matters such as teaching within different institutional settings and delivery modes (including online), determining learning objectives and assessment instruments, crafting a syllabus, designing lesson plans, and selecting instructional materials including OER (Open Educational Resources) and other alternatives to expensive textbooks in relation to issues of equity and access. Throughout, we will focus on student learning, on creating an inclusive instructional environment, and on professional ethics as involved in the ways we teach literature. The course is intended to strengthen graduate students' abilities and confidence as teachers now, and their readiness for professional scholarship and for the academic job market later (most faculty jobs in literature are at teaching-focused institutions). We will also consider career diversity: since professional careers other than faculty appointments can often include forms of teaching, aspects of this course may be useful for other career options too.","3 Credits"

While existing seminars focus on comparative studies organized according to concepts such as literary theory, period, theme, or genre, through the proposed new seminars the Department of Comparative Literature seeks to provide visibility for the full complement of courses that reflect the department's global perspective. These proposals also respond to the College's policy to avoid repeated use of the 597 number for similar subject-matter. Thus we are proposing three separate comparative courses on Asian, African, and Inter-American literatures.

"Comparative Literature (CMLIT)","CMLIT 524","Comparative Arab/ic Literature and Criticism","This course provides students with a comprehensive overview of modern Arab/ic literature, in dialogue with critical approaches that illuminate these texts within a comparative framework. By examining the critical interventions and debates that have shaped Arabic literature up until our present moment, this course invites students to attend to the manifold ways that this literature engages the major theoretical paradigms of global literary studies. It subsequently de-provincializes these debates beyond the limited purview of ethno-linguistic, philological, or geopolitical divisions of the field. It instead situates this literature as an active agent within world literary debates and criticism, both past and present. In this regard, the course will invite students to critically reframe the (neo)colonial or (neo)orientalist categories of the `Middle East' and `Near East,' and to consider other supra- and transnational exchanges staged across Asia, Africa, and the Mediterranean, as well as in the diaspora. In so doing, the course aims to look beyond the exclusive lens of the (post)colonial, or binary models of center/periphery, that dominate discussions of `third-world' literature. In moving away from the siloing of these traditions within Area Studies, the course considers the repercussions of these debates for narrative, aesthetic, geopolitical, theoretical, and pedagogical concerns across the study of Comparative Literature. Students will read a wide variety of literary texts in English translation, spanning a range of genres (prose, poetry, drama, film). Alongside these works, they will engage with critical and philosophical writings from the Arab/ic context, on topics such as aesthetics and the sublime, affects and embodiment, futurity and dystopia, ecocriticism and the Anthropocene, language, modernity/postmodernism, globalization, trauma, and more. After having taken this class, students will have gained a sound grasp of the field, as well as its literary and historical dimensions. They will also have developed a critical understanding of the current challenges and directions of the study of modern Arab/ic literature.","3 Credits"

"Curriculum and Instruction (CI)","CI 512","Contemporary Educational Ethnography","Recommended Preparations:  Qualitative Research course or permission of instructor. This seminar shows students how to use contemporary ethnographic theories and methods for education research to inform educational practice and policy. The contemporary movement might arguably be situated in the controversies of the 1980s and 90s, exemplified in Clifford and Marcus's book, Writing Culture, in which they identified the epistemological and political predicaments and controversies pertaining to ""the crisis of representation"" in the field of anthropology.CI 512addresses methodological and theoretical approaches informed though literary, reflexive, postmodern, poststructural, feminist, multisensory, multimodal, multivocal, and postcolonial turns and the ways in which they inform educational ethnography. The course focuses on a comprehensive view of education-schools, cultural and community centers, home life- as sites for all ages to learn to become members of their culture(s). A significant and regularly occurring aspect of the class involves students engaging in contemporary ethnographic practices such as cartographic, photographic/videographic, arts-based, alternative writing, walking/movement, sensory, performative, and multimodal.

"Curriculum and Instruction (CI)","CI 515","Foundations of Educational Research","Students read the philosophical foundations of education research, study how philosophies influence methodologies, and analyze current educational problems. This course is designed for students entering doctoral programs in the College of Education. Our students are studying to become education researchers within a highly politicized environment. For example, particular definitions of education research and government policies that favor some types of research practices over others provide opportunities for and set limits upon the work of education researchers. Public controversies likewise contribute to challenges faced by education researchers who find their work affirmed or discounted by particular definitions and policies. In order to explore these controversies and to allow students to begin identifying their own ""positionality"" with regard to research, this course begins with a reading of the history and philosophies of education research (primarily focusing on the United States). The course goals are: -     to identify underlying assumptions of competing forms of social inquiry, each determined to uncover new knowledge; -     to bring those assumptions to bear on education research in chosen fields of study; and -     to begin to develop one's own positions in order to direct further study and research. Specifically, through instructor facilitation and group discussions, students will come to understand major philosophical perspectives that permeate and drive research methodologies in education: positivism, postpositivism, interpretivism, critical theory, poststructuralism, and pragmatism. These understandings allow students to recognize the methodological assumptions that inform published research studies and to discover how methodologies might inform the research they wish to conduct as students and practitioners. Although the course is not required by any particular doctoral program in the College of Education, it is suggested for students who consider research important to their future careers and who see benefits in exploring the methodological options available.","3 Credits/Maximum of 999"

Over the course of only about ten years, Vygotsky and his circle produced a substantial body of theoretical and empirical work that challenged basic epistemological and ontological premises of psychology and that outlined a new way of understanding human abilities and their development. The framework Vygotsky elaborated has come to be referred to as Cultural Historical psychology, emphasizing the fundamental role of mediation in shaping human psychology, mediation through historically created artifacts available in particular cultures and through forms of social interaction. In the decades since Vygotsky's death, Cultural Historical psychology has been further developed by researchers around the world who have brought Vygotsky's theoretical proposals to bear on questions and problems as diverse as special education, psychological and educational measurement, early childhood education, psycho-therapy, teacher education, linguistics and communication, adult and workforce education, and political and social change. The course is organized around carefully selected, seminal readings, emphasizing primary texts authored by Vygotsky but complemented by secondary sources generally regarded as leading interpretations. Beginning with an examination of Vygotsky's enterprise to establish a unified, scientific psychology grounded in Marxian dialectics (historical materialism), the course engages with concepts and principles definitive of Cultural Historical psychology that in some cases have become highly influential in a number of disciplines and that in others are only beginning to be understood. These include mediation, Zone of Proximal Development/ZPD (zona blizhaishego razvitia/ZBR), spontaneous and scientific concepts, teaching/learning-and-development (obuchenie), inner and private speech, units of analysis and meaning (znachenie/smysl), and perezhivanie, among others. In this way, students obtain a deep understanding of the theory, both in the context of Vygotsky's own writings and the specific problems he sought to address but also in its contemporary applications. This understanding, in turn, enables students to critically evaluate uses of Vygotsky's ideas in their particular area of study while also providing the background necessary to employ the theory in their own research. The course is intended for students in all areas of education, human development, and applied linguistics. No previous knowledge of Vygotsky's work is required.","3 Credits"
"Curriculum and Instruction (CI)","CI 520","Democratic Education","Americans have long considered their public schools to be central in the cultivation of democracy. As such, public school teachers in the United States-at all levels and of all subjects-play a key role in perpetuating democracy. Despite teachers' critical role, formal preparation for this task via professional development of teacher education is questionable at best. Little scholarly attention is paid to what teachers need to know or be able to do pedagogically to help cultivate democratic thinking in students and rarely is the responsibility extended to teachers outside of the social studies field. This course takes seriously the role of democratic practice in education writ large, asking students to consider the purposes, theories, practices, and possibility of democratic education across a variety of contexts: adult education, K-12 education, alternative education, and teacher education. In this course we will consider the purposes of democratic education in the current U.S. context, examine theories of democratic education for democracy, and explore models of democratic education in practice.","3 Credits"
"Curriculum and Instruction (CI)","CI 521","Crafting the Systematic Literature Review in Education","This course is a graduate level seminar designed for students who would benefit from learning how to conduct a systematic and analytical literature review. This course is appropriate both for graduate students in the early stages of determining a thesis or dissertation topic, and as well as advanced doctoral students who aim to engage in a systematic review of the literature in their chosen field. Class participants will critically analyze model literature reviews; determine criteria for inclusion and exclusion of research studies; systematically gather publications using academic databases; analyze and organize pertinent literature; and write a literature review focused on their topic of interest. The course follows a cognitive apprenticeship model of learning, such that the skills and processes involved in writing a literature review in education research will be taught within the context of the doctoral student participants' own research interests and will be explored and practiced within their professional and program objectives.","3 Credits"

Foucault is arguably one of the pre-eminent Western social theorists of the 20th century. Researchers and theorists working from post-structural, critical and socio-cultural perspectives frequently turn to Foucault's concepts of power, discipline, and subjectivity as powerful analytic lenses for analyzing the daily lives and practices of students and teachers in classrooms as well as more generally the field of Education, educational politics and policies, and educational institutions. Additionally, given the tremendous impact of Foucault's work in multiple disciplines throughout the academe, the ability to read and apply the theories of Foucault can facilitate broader reading and discussion across a variety of disciplines. In the class, students will devote approximately 2/3 of the time to reading original works by Foucault and brief commentaries on these works, and 1/3 of the time reading applications of Foucault's work by education researchers and theorists. The primary work load of the class is reading. Reading Foucault is not an easy task. Students can expect careful scaffolding of their learning through classroom discussions, a required on-line discussion forum, and frequent feedback from the instructor. Preparation for and participation in class discussions and in the building of a vibrant learning environment are required components of the class.","3 Credits"
"Curriculum and Instruction (CI)","CI 530","Identities in Second Language Learning","This course investigates the ongoing collaborative construction and negotiation of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual, and social class identities in second language learning (SLL). It examines how we learn to speak our multiple selves in a new language, for example, how we learn to language race according to our prior background and the cultural practices and understandings of second language contexts. The impact of these social identities and polemics of racism, sexism, xenophobia, colonialism, homophobia, and elitism that arise when we study them are not restricted to experiences outside the classroom, nor can they be divorced from language curriculum and pedagogy. Examining such issues in SLL can be challenging due to the belief that raising them courts controversy unnecessarily and goes against mindsets that many value, such as colorblindness, because language learning is an area that naturally welcomes and fosters integration and interaction between different groups in multicultural education. Course participants will interrogate the idea of colorblind language learning classrooms and curricula and examine how the realities of language learners' differentiated, inequitable access, treatment, and experiences in multilingual contexts challenge the field's declared values of multiculturalism in education.","3 Credits"

It goes without saying."" The purpose of this course is to foreground the concept of place and real places in our daily lives and academic work, particularly with respect to education (including schooling), to make sure that it does not go without saying. What is (a) place? How is it formed, bounded, made meaningful? How is it personal and social? What are its relationships with time and space? What are its relationships with experience, culture, citizenship, margins, diversity, and so many other topics? How does it shape living, especially learning and teaching in schools, and how is it shaped by these things? How do I and we fit in? And, following the feminist educational philosopher Nel Noddings, ""should schools teach for an understanding and love of place or should they now offer curricula designed to transcend place?"" Through a seminar format focused specifically on educational contexts, we will study place from a range of interdisciplinary perspectives and consider what these landscapes of place mean for teaching, learning, and educational research. Readings will draw from the fields of anthropology, art/s, curriculum, ecology, geography, indigenous thought, literature, philosophy, and sociology, all intersecting with education. Assignments will include citizenship in the community of this course, personal reflection about lived place(s) inside of schools and out, critical analyses of the literature on the intersections of education and place(s), and a final project focused on one aspect of how education and place(s) intersect that is of particular interest to the student. In dialogue, collaboration, the reading of each other's writings, and other activities such as a walking tour of students' most-meaningful places on campus, participants in this course will be and become citizens of the place (and its many physical, digital, and relational places) of the course. Students will exit the course with a broad understanding of the complexity of place(s) in education, including in the work of teachers and researchers.","3 Credits"

This seminar explores girls cultures in different textual and material forms including books, toys, magazines, and new media. Students will employ feminist cultural theories to compare historical and contemporary girls cultures in relation to educational research and practice. This will provide a framework to locate girls at the center of research and action in order for graduate students to engage in methodologies that are not simply about girls but ""for"" ""with"" and ""by"" girls. Key topics include the misperception of girls (popular) culture as only a contemporary phenomenon, the role of girls as consumers plus producers of culture, and recurrent issues in girls cultures such as sexualization and hyperfeminity.","3 Credits"

"Curriculum and Instruction (CI)","CI 552","The Methods Course in Teacher Education: Challenges and Opportunities","This course will focus on the 'methods course' in teacher education. A common feature of teacher education programs in almost any setting, methods courses are those courses teacher candidates take that address how to teach. Of course, 'how to teach' is nowhere near as simple as that would sound, and even less simple is how to teach how to teach, in a way that will actually influence how candidates will teach. Students in this course will read research on methods courses, analyze many examples at Penn State and elsewhere, and inquire together about methods course design. Students will explore: · WHY have methods courses at all? Are there things to learn about how to teach that can't be learned through field experience alone? · WHAT shall the content of methods be? Are there such things as 'general methods' or must methods courses always be content-area-specific? What shall students read and come to know in a methods course? · WHO shall teach methods courses, and who shall take them? What happens when practitioners teach methods, as opposed to university faculty? Or when we co-teach? · WHEN shall methods courses occur in the timespan of a teacher preparation program? Must they be concurrent with field experience, or should they precede it? What prerequisite knowledge or experiences matter for the success of a methods course? · WHERE shall methods courses be taught? On site in a school? At the university? Somewhere else? What about online? · HOW shall methods be taught? What course activities actually help teacher candidates learn to teach? What are appropriate uses of readings? Peer teaching? Classroom inquiry? By the end of the course, students will have articulated research-based answers to these questions. In addition, students will be able to apply the available research to existing methods courses in their own current and/or future context(s).","3 Credits"
"Curriculum and Instruction (CI)","CI 560","Theories of Childhood","The study of childhood from cultural, historical, psychological and philosophical perspectives.CI 560Theories of Childhood (3) In this course, participants will explore the highly variable ways that childhood has been constructed and enacted across multiple cultures and throughout history. Participants will begin by considering how notions of the nature of childhood, for example, children as innocent, as primitive, or as blank slates have functioned across history and in their memories and sense of nostalgia about childhood. Participants will expand their understanding of historic and contemporary childhoods through comparative studies of children. Participants will examine and critique normative theories of child development and will finish with an examination of contemporary child culture, including play and how changes in global culture affect children's lives. The course instructor will provide the readings for the course, as well as background information and organizing topics. The instructor creates and assigns activities and provides or oversees discussion questions to organize student thinking for a productive discussion. It is the instructor's responsibility to create an environment conducive to students' development of an open, vibrant learning community; to establish and oversee course standards; and to assist students to achieve both the course objectives and their own. There are no prerequisites for this course. Given that all participants have had a childhood and some may be parents, the memories and experiences each participant brings may be both a help and a hindrance. That is, insofar as their own childhoods or those of their children cause them to believe that they already know what childhood is, class participants need to recognize the limitations of their memories and experiences. The diversity of childhoods that will be represented across the members of the course is a considerable resource for participants to develop an ever-broader understanding of the cultural and historical nature of childhood.","3 Credits"

Beginning with a course paper, conference paper, comps paper, thesis, pilot study, dissertation, or another pre-existing draft, writers will learn to frame, revise, and edit a scholarly article for submission to a journal. To do this, students will spend time addressing the genres and conventions of writing about education research for an academic audience, focusing on particular subfields in curriculum and instruction. Students will read and analyze published research in curriculum and instruction, study principles of rhetoric and style, practice collaboration and peer review, and engage in intensive revision and editing. Students will gain skill in dealing with the emotions of writing, work habits, giving and receiving feedback, and motivation. They will also work through concerns like organization, exposition and elaboration, and argument as well as matters of correctness and grammar. Students will consider the variations in epistemology, genre, and conventions of argument and of style for the wide range of subfields in curriculum and instruction as well as across education subfields. This includes attention to historical and contemporary divergences between fields and ways of bridging those as needed for dissemination research. Major assignments include analyses of target journals and representative articles, experiments in scheduling and writing habits, and weekly challenges in revising. In addition, students will work in intensive writing groups across the length of the term.

In this class, we will employ an understanding of literacy that broadens the definitions of texts and reading beyond paper books and our interactions with them. The unifying feature of the artifacts considered will be a consideration of their implications for education and, more specifically, education for social justice. Together we will explore the ways that race has come to be understood both historically and contemporarily in a range of contexts from those that are popular and social in nature to those that are scientific and academic. These understandings will inform our interrogations of educational and literacy topics. Our lived experiences will be a prominent and important feature of the class as will be the course readings-the grounding of our conversations.  By the end of this class, students can expect to have developed, bolstered or refined their own stances on race and how it can be taken up in educational and/or research work.

"Education (EDUC)","EDUC 815","Foundations of Education Research","While researchers working in the natural sciences typically share a common set of assumptions concerning their object of study, appropriate methods for investigating that object, and explanatory principles and concepts, the social and human sciences, including education, do not have this unity. Instead, a range of positions that developed in philosophy, primarily through the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, have led to very different, sometimes incongruous orientations to research involving human phenomena. These include Post-Positivism, Interpretivism, the Critical Tradition, Post-Structuralism, and Pragmatism. Although the beliefs, concerns, and priorities underlying these orientations are not always made explicit by researchers, they each offer specific views concerning how knowledge is produced and how that knowledge can best be put to use in the service of humankind. This course engages with these traditions in order to identify the assumptions and commitments underlying them, to appreciate the research that has emerged from each perspective, and to understand what each has to offer education professionals.","3 Credits"

The format of the course is a computer laboratory in which students work through a series of assignments designed to introduce them to the basics of spreadsheets and then to teach a broadening range of modeling and analytical skills using progressively more complex problems. Applications are stressed through the creation of models that emphasize the organization, analysis, and presentation of data concerning such topics as salary schedules, budget preparation and analysis, expenditure control, cost projections, and data development. In conjunction with model building, a variety of analytical techniques are used, such as graphing, frequency distributions, regression, what-if tables, pivot tables, and database applications.The work in the course is individual and students move at their own pace through the assignments. New concepts and techniques are introduced and demonstrated periodically by the instructor and are then used by the students in succeeding assignments. The course accommodates widely differing ranges of abilities possessed by students taking the course. No prior computer experience is necessary. Satisfactory completion of all assignments is required for the passing R grade.The course emphasizes the development of useful information for administrative decision-making. Students should finish the course with a new or renewed confidence in their ability to deal with a problem in which some quantitative analysis is necessary, to be able to organize the available data in a logical and helpful fashion, and to use an electronic spreadsheet to develop a serviceable model to aid in the analysis.","3 Credits"

"Educational Leadership Program (EDLDR)","EDLDR 559","School Improvement","The course examines how educational leaders at all levels can determine, promote, support, and achieve successful school improvement.EDLDR 559School Improvement (3) The last 20 years have witnessed unparalleled efforts to improve schools and raise student achievement. These initiatives include but are not limited to: (1) new content standards for mathematics, science, English, and social studies (2) increased requirements for high school graduation, (3) reduced class sizes, especially in the early grades, (4) new high-stakes state testing and assessment programs, and (5) the performance-based accountability requirements set by No Child Left Behind. Yet, despite all this activity and attention, significant changes in student achievement and in basic school practices have been slow at best. While there has been some improvement, success has been largely scant and spotty.The reasons for slow progress are many and complex. However, one that is receiving growing attention is the need for stronger school leaders (including teachers, principals, superintendents, and other educators) who can direct and implement changes in curriculum, instruction, and school organization. There is growing consensus in the research literature that school improvement and school leadership are largely inseparable - that leadership is a critical element in order for schools to improve. While focusing on leadership without attending to the many other conditions that affect school effectiveness is not productive, it is clear that leadership is an important ingredient in the mix of strategies for improving schools.The course addresses three major questions: (1) What is school improvement? (2) What does it involve? (3) How do we do it? To accomplish this, the course first focuses on several general models developed for school improvement purposes. After this the focus shifts to an examination of the component pieces of school improvement, including leadership, professional development/professional learning communities, and a focus on teaching and learning (including standards, instruction, and assessments). All these are connected the larger discussion of what education leaders need to know and be able to do to strengthen instruction and raise student achievement. If leaders are to nurture better teaching and learning, they will need greater familiarity with promising instructional approaches, new curricular materials, and ways to adapt them to a particular school's circumstances.","3 Credits"

A primary objective behind the organization and design of this course is to firmly link theory to practice by addressing the question of what does organizational theory and research have to say that is generally important and useful to the educational practitioner/scholar. This objective is addressed through the belief that practitioners must be self-conscious about what they are doing so organizational action becomes enlightened action; that is, action that has to do with understanding and using multiple perspectives of reality. What are needed are purposeful attempts to construct or reconstitute knowledge so that events, situations and problems are confronted or engaged from multiple points of view. Decision-making and problem-solving activities thus become acts of deliberate, conscious thoughtfulness (reflective thinking, if you will) designed to reconstruct holistic knowledge in order to facilitate enlightened action. Specifically, the objectives of the course are to assist students: (1) to acquire a foundational knowledge or organizational and administrative theory; (2) to use multiple organizational theories in understanding school organizations and leadership roles in these organizations; (3) to develop a framework or schema from which to reflectively think about and develop an understanding of school organizations and problems of practice; (4) to develop a concept of leadership within school organization; (5) to develop an understanding of organizational change processes and attending issues of school change; and (6) to become familiar with organizational perspectives on schools and schooling issues and problems.","3 Credits"

This course examines the fiscal management concepts and techniques needed by educational leaders in order to plan, control, and evaluate their operations effectively. The primary means for managing the fiscal resources of the district is through the annual budget. Administrators and other educators use the budgeting process to plan educational programs for the upcoming year, to allocate the available funds among competing programs, and to control expenditures in order not to exceed allowable limits. The primary purpose of the course is to acquaint students with the central importance of budgeting in management of schools and districts and to show how mastery of budgeting will make them more effective educational leaders. Procedures for identifying the necessary budgetary activities, as well as constraints, are discussed to provide a management context for the process. Emphasis is placed on the critical, and often neglected, step of formulating expenditure and revenue estimates to teach students how budget numbers are created. Budget modification and analysis techniques are reviewed to provide skills for changing and explaining budget amounts. Monitoring procedures that prevent overexpenditure of budgeted funds are also discussed.","3 Credits"

The course focuses on three main areas that are foundational to building understandings of teacher leadership. The first of these areas focuses on who teacher leaders are, how they become teacher leaders, and what it is that teacher leaders do. Both formal and informal roles are discussed along with professional and personal qualities that appear to distinguish teacher leaders. Finally, a clear distinction is made between formal administrative leadership, i.e., building principals and their duties, and the role of teacher leaders. The second area uses a systems perspective to focus on the organizational supports and capacities that are necessary for teacher leadership to grow and flourish. At the district level, the focus is on the development of supportive policies and appropriate programs. At the school level, the focus is on developing a culture of continuous learning/continuous improvement in support of teacher leadership. The third area examines not only how one develops teacher leadership but also what is necessary to sustain and nourish it in schools. The focus is on building relationships, distributing power and authority, and aligning professional learning. These three areas culminate in the development of a practice-based conceptual model of teacher leadership.","3 Credits"

This course is designed for students entering doctoral programs in the College of Education. Our students are studying to become education researchers within a highly politicized environment. For example, particular definitions of education research and government policies that favor some types of research practices over others provide opportunities for and set limits upon the work of education researchers. Public controversies likewise contribute to challenges faced by education researchers who find their work affirmed or discounted by particular definitions and policies. In order to explore these controversies and to allow students to begin identifying their own ""positionality"" with regard to research, this course begins with a reading of the history and philosophies of education research (primarily focusing on the United States). The course goals are: -     to identify underlying assumptions of competing forms of social inquiry, each determined to uncover new knowledge; -     to bring those assumptions to bear on education research in chosen fields of study; and -     to begin to develop one's own positions in order to direct further study and research. Specifically, through instructor facilitation and group discussions, students will come to understand major philosophical perspectives that permeate and drive research methodologies in education: positivism, postpositivism, interpretivism, critical theory, poststructuralism, and pragmatism. These understandings allow students to recognize the methodological assumptions that inform published research studies and to discover how methodologies might inform the research they wish to conduct as students and practitioners. Although the course is not required by any particular doctoral program in the College of Education, it is suggested for students who consider research important to their future careers and who see benefits in exploring the methodological options available.","3 Credits/Maximum of 999"

If, as the old sociological adage goes ""demography is destiny,"" then our destiny is educationally transformed demography.  Interdisciplinary research across demography, sociology, neuropsychology, and epidemiology is developing a strong research literature about how the thinking style, behavior, and attitudes of the educated human radically change fundamental dynamics underlying the world's population. The whole way in which we come to our jobs, spouses, and lifestyles; how many children we have and how we raise them; how long we are likely to live, and what will be our eventual demise are all heavily influenced by how much education we have had. The collective force of widespread education and its influence on rising cognitive abilities, scripts for living, and economic well-being are creating a distinctly new type of human population with major benefits and future challenges for a sustainable human population.  At the same time, individuals' schooling is also influenced by demographic change.

"Energy, Environmental, and Food Economics (EEFE)","EEFE 529","Foundations of Economic Welfare Analysis","How do we know which forms of economic organization are preferred to others? How do we evaluate who wins and loses within the economic sphere? How do we know when the allocation of goods and services by the economic system is societally optimal? How do we define what is societally optimal? When do government policies improve societal welfare and when do they worsen it? How do we measure societal welfare? When should governments intervene in the economic system and to what extent? How large should the economic system be relative to the natural system? How much should present generations consume relative to future ones? Welfare economics is a branch of economics that seeks to answer these questions. In this course we will develop the concepts and tools needed to do so. Our primary focus will be on evaluating the efficiency and equity implications of public policies using modern theory and empirical methods. In the first part of the course we review the ways in which we can and cannot quantify the welfare of economic agents. We begin by reviewing the foundations of microeconomic theory which we use to analyze how the welfare of economic agents is altered due to exogenous changes in prices and/or income. Using these welfare measures, in the second part of the course we examine how public policies affect the welfare of economic agents using tools from public finance. Since our ultimate goal is applying welfare theory to empirical questions we will also review in part the empirical methods and tools required for conducting state of the art research in this area.","3 Credits"

"Energy, Environmental, and Food Economics (EEFE)","EEFE 531","Applied Microeconometrics I","In this course, we will study microeconometrics, a subfield that encompasses specification as well as a variety of estimation, computational, and simulation methods that allow us to pursue specification and parameterization of econometric models suitable for analyzing micro-level data. We will see that these methods support an enriched basis for examining the validity of microeconomic theory, and also extend the analytics feasibly tackled by microeconomics. At the micro-level of empirical analysis, we will see our theory predicts high frequencies of corner solutions, abrupt switching, and discontinuities. In each case, these predictions are also apparent in micro data. Together, these conditions call for methods that go beyond simple continuous choice functions and equilibria often found adequate for aggregate static and dynamic modeling. Knowledge of these new methods is essential to empirical learning in most areas of contemporary applied microeconomics. These methods evolved to support the active application of microeconomic theories of micro-level behavior (e.g. discrete choice, corner solutions, cusps in dynamic paths) as well as to address peculiar features of micro-level data such as error-in-measurement, availability of only binary or polychotomous indicators of continuous variables, and substantial heterogeneity. Theory is relied upon to specify models prior to estimation, to specify characteristics of data sets, and to interpret results.","3 Credits"

In this course, we will explore four topics in the field of computational economics: computable general equilibrium modeling, growth modeling, uncertainty and formal monte carlo analysis, and agent-based modeling. The overall goal of this course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of computational economics so that they are prepared to build unique mathematical models to address complex situations that have not yet been encountered.

E MCH (M E 560) 500 Solid Mechanics (3) This course introduces students to the fundamental principles and basic methods used in solid mechanics. Using indicial notation and integral formulations provides a foundation for more advanced study in continuum mechanics (E MCH 540) and finite element analysis (E MCH 560) specifically and in mechanics in general. The materials behavior is restricted to linear elastic and the emphasis is on stress analysis. Students are expected to have an understanding of elementary mechanics of materials (such as E MCH 013).The course objectives are to: 1) provide students with a firm foundation in solid mechanics. 2) introduce continuum mechanics concepts, variational methods, and the formulation used in finite element analysis. 3) enable students to formulate and solve the boundary value problems commonly encountered in the analysis of structures.The study of solid mechanics starts with the definition of stress and strain and how the two are related by material law. Field equations that relate strain to displacement, ensure a single valued displacement field, and the balance momentum are formulated. These are partial differential equations that can only be solved subject to known boundary and initial conditions. The field equations and boundary conditions comprise a boundary value problem that is usually difficult to solve exactly. Variational methods are used to bound or approximate the solution. The finite element method employs variational methods to formulate generic elements and is a computational tool for solving boundary value problems for complex geometries.","3 Credits"

The types of deformation behavior considered in the course are linear elasticity (isotropic or anisotropic), viscoelasticity and plastic deformation.  For the elastic behavior, the emphasis will be on the way elastic behavior is controlled by atomic structure and microstructure.  The constitutive laws that describe this behavior and the assumptions on which they are based will be introduced.  The next phase of the course considers the range of deformation behavior from purely viscous (linear or non-linear) to viscoelastic.  Initially, the emphasis will be on the effects of temperature and strain history and the way this behavior is described by mechanical analogs. The effect of structure on creep and stress relaxation will be described.  The use of linear viscoelasticity in describing the sintering process will also be included.  In ductile crystalline materials, deformation is associated with the movement of dislocations.  The types of dislocations, their stress fields and energies will be described.  These aspects will then be combined with structural features by including considerations of slip geometry and obstacles to dislocation motion.

"English (ENGL)","ENGL 555","Visualizing Gender","This course analyzes how gender identities relate to the creation, use, and analysis of visual artifacts and bodily practices. Visual texts condition and are conditioned by intersectional embodiments of gender. In an attempt to understand and critically evaluate the role visual culture plays in our gendered lives as a dominant conduit of knowledge and identity production, this seminar examines visual processes and objects as they are informed and shaped by a nexus of gender, race, sexuality, class, nationality, and other forms of identity. The visualization of gendered forms of identity involves codes that produce bodies as signifiers of chaos, order, beauty, disease, nature, culture, evil, and virtue, including actions bisected according to binaries of masculinity and femininity. The seminar employs analytical approaches to these dynamics, including feminist, queer, and critical race theories of the visual as ways of interrogating a range of visual artifacts and bodily practices. After surveying key foundational texts, the course predominantly engages contemporary works and practices along complex gender matrices, including new directions in visual culture from the 1990s onward.","3 Credits"

Readings will range from novels to classic film theory, cultural studies, belles-lettres, film criticism, radical poetics, apparatus theory, media theory, and contemporary philosophy.","3 Credits/Maximum of 12"
"English (ENGL)","ENGL 557","Authors and Artists","This course explores formal and historical links between literature and art in modernist movements. ""Ut pictura poesis"" (like painting [is] poetry). This statement, originally articulated by the ancient Roman poet Horace, has been quoted and debated ever since. Links between art and literature have exerted a formative influence on the development of modern fiction and poetry as authors and artists in various avant-garde groupings collaborated and competed to generate modes of artistic expression appropriate to modernity. This course examines those interactions. Course objectives are to bring together for comparative examination: -    formal or generic relationships between texts and images at particular historical moments. -     issues of creative collaboration and cross-pollination between writers and artists, which have been crucially important in the history of literature and poetry. -     conceptions of creativity as these have been expressed by writers using the figure of the artist. This course allows students to explore the ways knowledge of literature and skills in critical reading can be rewardingly brought to bear on the visual arts, and to consider how visual art can illuminate the workings of literature both for individual readers and in the classroom.","3 Credits"

Success in this class depends upon the student's ability to set priorities, organize materials, followup on initial contacts with presses and editors, and revise all reviews to publishable standards. Students begin by reading published book reviews and two texts (one poetry, one fiction) assigned by the instructor. Analyzing the structure of the published reviews, students draft model 200- and 550-word reviews, using the published reviews as guides. As the course progresses, students contact publishing houses and presses to request review copies, while simultaneously writing to editors with project proposals. With longer reviews--700 and 1,000 words--students engage complex issues about the economics and politics of publishing. Readings from the course Sampler (provided by instructor) inspire students to position themselves as literary citizens in the national conversation about contemporary writing. ""The Writer as Critic"" supplements the MFA course offerings in non-fiction. Students in all genres may practice advanced expository prose while gaining a practical skill. For students in the MFA program, this course fulfills a literature seminar requirement.

"Finance (FIN)","FIN 881","Fundamentals of Financial Markets","This course provides a broad understanding of the pricing mechanism of the bond, equity, and foreign exchange markets. The course also gives students an overview of analytical methodologies that help market participants discern asset price from asset value. How can a market participant understand when they are ""buying low and selling high""? In particular, the course investigates the following questions related to understanding financial markets and why this understanding is important to success as a strategic corporate manager: ¿  - What is the language of financial markets' how do market actors read financial statements with a critical eye to understand assets' future value? - What is the difference between price and value? - What, theoretically, is the ""intrinsic value of an asset? What analytical techniques can the financial market participant use to approximate intrinsic value? -  How are decisions made given that market results are uncertain? - How are decisions made probabilistically using the basic concepts of expected value and standard deviation? - What is the difference between an ""optimal"" decision using market data vs. an ""accurate"" decision? - How do we understand that the concept of risk is multi-layered and multi-dimensional? - Which risks are associated with which markets, i.e., bonds vs. equities etc., and how do market participants mitigate risk through hedging? - Are markets rational or are they subject to ""behavioral"" characteristics? - How do we understand and quantify our corporation's risk profile and how does that determine our decisions to employ capital in one asset market vs. another? At the end of the course students should have a sense that decisions to buy or sell an asset in any financial market are imperfect, and that new information alters the value of assets extremely quickly. As a result, students must develop a keen sense of how markets are moving, and why they are moving in one direction or the other. More importantly, students will realize that decisions must be made, assets must be bought or sold, and hopefully, valuation techniques lead to profitable outcomes.","1-3 Credits/Maximum of 3"

We will alternate an in-depth reading of Joris-Karl Huysmans' classic text of Decadence, A Rebours (1884), with close study of the visual arts, music, scientific discourse, and historical and philosophical texts in order to identify what were considered by contemporaries the major sources of decadence during that era: among others, `new women,' Jews and other social and `racial' inferiors, democratization, urbanization, and the triumph of scientific and rationalistic thought. We will also examine presumed symptoms of decadence: neurasthenia, declining birth rates, perceived social `pathologies' such as prostitution, crime, and drugs; homosexuality, androgyny, and other supposed sexual `perversions'; and psychological conditions such as hysteria. Finally, we will examine what contemporaries considered antidotes to decadence: visits to spas, the cult of heroes, sports, a return to faith. We will analyze how artists and authors of the period among others, Aubrey Beardsley, Félicien Rops, Edvard Munch, Fernand Knopff, Jean Lorrain, Oscar Wilde, and others' valorized the notion of decadence, celebrating it and making it the touchstone of a key esthetic of the late-nineteenth century, overlapping and echoing other trends and esthetics, such as Symbolism, Art nouveau, the Pre-Raphaëlites, Japonism, the Arts and Crafts Movement, Jugendstil, Estheticism, Dandyism, and Snobbism","3 Credits"

Geospatial professionals need to posses a working knowledge of current and future GPS capabilities because GPS positioning is so prevalent in geographic information systems (GIS) applications in government, industry, and academia. GPS has always been a dual use system, military and civilian. From the beginning, GPS signals have been available with no direct user fees. GPS is used now in all of transportation-aviation, maritime, railroad, highway and mass transit. Satellite positions also plays critical roles in telecommunications, land surveying, law enforcement, emergency response, precision agriculture, mining, finance, and scientific research. It controls computer networks, air traffic, power grids, and so on. As the scope of GPS has expanded, the system continues to evolve. Course Objectives:GEOG 862provides students with an opportunity to develop an in-depth understanding of the Global Positioning System that exceeds the basic awareness that is cultivated in prerequisite courses. For example, while it is useful to know that a minimum of 24 GPS satellites ensure 24-hour worldwide GPS coverage, it is equally important to understand why there are more than the minimum on orbit. Students inGEOG 862learn that redundancy is necessary in a system upon which much of the U.S. economy now depends. Society's reliance on satellite positioning mandates GPS modernization. Student Activities: The course consists of four weekly lessons. Each lesson will require a minimum of 8-12 hours of activity. Lessons will include weekly lectures (via synchronous Web conference and/or streaming video), threaded discussion, readings, two quizzes and two writing assignments about concepts and tools in GPS Modernization.

"German (GER)","GER 510","Literary Theory: An Introduction","Introduction to the major theoretical approaches to the contemporary study of culture (literature, film, art and politics).GER 510Literary Theory: An Introduction (3) This seminar will introduce students to contemporary literary and cultural theory in an effort to provide them with the methodological tools they need to undertake cutting-edge literary and cultural analysis themselves. German Studies in the U.S. has at least two defining characteristics. First, though, at least for those of us in German Departments, its emphasis is mainly on culture, it is genuinely interdisciplinary, attempting to explore how cultural products and practices (defined as extending far beyond the traditional canon of German literature) are constituted by and help to constitute history and politics. And, secondly, it advances its interdisciplinary analyses by drawing increasingly on new methodologies elaborated by Anglo-American and foreign cultural theorists. Among the theoretical approaches we may focus on will be formalism and structuralism, psychoanalysis, Marxism, cultural studies, feminism, gender studies, and queer theory, and post-colonial theory. These new theories have profoundly transformed disciplines such as Anglo-American literary studies, comparative literature, women's studies, history, and anthropology, since the Seventies. In this course we shall find out if/how such theories could transform German Studies, too. The course is reading-intensive and students are expected to invest most of their time in reading and preparing for class discussions. Regular attendance and informed participation in class discussion will be required. This involves reading all assigned articles on a regular basis (20%); oral presentation of one weekly section (30%); second oral presentation that includes a sample analysis of the assigned texts (20%); and one 12-15 page paper due at the end of the semester (30%). German 51 0 will be the second unit in a three-course package intended to provide beginning graduate students with a set of correlated introductory courses. German 510 is the only wide-ranging course in theory offered by the Department for incoming students. This course will be offered once a year with 5 to 1 0 students (1 5 max) per offering.","3 Credits"

No prior knowledge of linguistics or phonology is assumed. Topics discussed include articulatory phonetics, the phoneme, distinctive features, and common phonological processes in German such as final devoicing, prosody, prosodic morphology and dialectal variation. The class will practice phonetic transcription of German and English. We will discuss common phonetic and phonological difficulties presented by German for native speakers of English. In addition to practical applications of phonetics, the class will investigate theoretical concepts such as the phoneme, distinctive features, lexical stress, the syllable and the prosodic foot. Reading assignments include scholarly articles employing different theoretical frameworks and excerpts from seminal works in the field. Frameworks to be discussed include derivational approaches and Optimality Theory. The class will also examine dialectal variation with a particular emphasis on differences between Low, Middle and Upper German dialects. Each students will make a presentation investigating the phonological system of a German dialect. Evaluation is based on problems, class presentations and a final research paper.","3 Credits"

Topics discussed include the basic syntactic constituents in German, the verbal bracket and movement rules, German argument structure, the tense/mood/aspect system for German verbs, the connection between pragmatics and word order in German, and dialectal variation as it relates to German syntax. Emphasis will also be placed on how these different areas of German syntax are related to descriptive grammar rules as presented in many German language classes. Reading assignments include scholarly articles employing different theoretical frameworks, including minimalism, and excerpts from seminal works in the field. Evaluation is based on problem sets, two take-home exams and a research paper.","3 Credits"
"German (GER)","GER 524","Remapping the Holocaust","In most university courses, the Holocaust is taught chronologically, beginning with the rise of the Nazi Party and then following the German armies through Europe and into the Soviet Union. The retreat of those same forces beginning in 1943 parallels the concentration and professionalization of the killing process which then begins to break down as the war comes to an end. This narrative is not incorrect, and certainly makes sense for introductory courses. Yet it also mirrors the perpetrators' perspective. A graduate course allows us to explore different perspectives on the war and genocide and how these affect both the periodization and the geography of the Holocaust. In this course we will examine a number of divergent historiographic trends regarding the origins, enactment, end, and aftermath of the Holocaust. These will help students to think more broadly about the place of the Holocaust in world history and how new theories, methods and questions can be applied to other historical events.","3 Credits"
"German (GER)","GER 530","The Frankfurt School & the Politics of Visual Aesthetics","The course examines the Frankfurt School's critical theories regarding visual strategies for representing and challenging urban consumer culture. The course will examine critical theories by members of the Frankfurt School regarding visual strategies for representing and challenging urban consumer culture. The course will center on German Marxist theories about how the rise of urban mass culture at the beginning of the twentieth century produced Modernist forms of visual representation. The course will examine how the spread of fashion-driven behavior had dramatic implications for aesthetic theory, film, architecture, and literature. The course will provide a survey of the most important works in the German critical tradition and the major thinkers associated with the Frankfurt School. These include Georg Simmel, Georg Lukacs, Siegfried Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, and Jürgen Habermas, among others. Students will learn how these modern theories relate to the German Idealist tradition, particularly Kant, Hegel, and Nietzsche, as well as the history of German Marxism. Topics include the psychology of the metropolitan individual, the commodification of culture, money, and interpersonal relationships, the architecture of shopping, visual advertising through posters and photography, and cinema as a means of understanding social relations, as well as the role of visual media in public debate. The course will consider how modernist architecture, particularly from the Bauhaus school, redefined urban spaces and introduced new functionalist designs. The course will examine how Frankfurt School thinkers responded to the provocative design proposals presented by modernist architects. Students will examine specific modernist designs for consumer products to examine the relationship between the appearance of a commodity and its use, in order to understand how appearance and function are interdependent within modernism. In broad terms, class discussions will focus on such questions as: How does the relationship between the visual image and society change under industrial capitalism? What political functions do visual images have in consumer culture? What visual mechanisms does the ""culture industry"" deploy to organize public consciousness? What critical responses are available to visual artists within a mass-market economy? The course will provide students an historical understanding of early twentieth-century German consumer culture and its visual representation, while also offering them critical intellectual tools to understand the social and economic implications of visual images within consumer culture. The course will be taught in English with readings in both languages.","3 Credits/Maximum of 999"
"German (GER)","GER 532","Holocaust and Visual Culture","This course studies how art, literature, film, and other media can provide a perspective on one of the most horrific events in human history, the Holocaust: the genocidal murder of more than six million men, women, and children (mostly Jewish) under the Nazi regime during World War II. The course examines the theoretical questions involved in any attempt to capture what appears to be beyond comprehension in terms of moral outrage and the sheer scale, inhumanity, and bureaucratic efficiency of the violence perpetrated by the Nazis. This course examines formal approaches of depicting the Holocaust in literature and film, as well as photography, museum installations, and memorials. Topics to be discussed include include memorialization (Holocaust museums and memorials), mass murder of the disabled, national guilt, survivor's guilt, stigmatization, and the ethics of historical representation. The course will analyze cinematic strategies for representing the unrepresentable, dark humor about the Holocaust, the persistence of the past, Nazi propaganda, Holocaust photography, trauma theories, graphic novels, the Nuremberg trials, survivor memoirs, representations of the Nuremberg Code and the International Bill of Norms, and possibilities for art after Auschwitz.","3 Credits"
"German (GER)","GER 534","History of German Film and Photography","This course will examine the history, theory, and practice of German photographic and moving picture technology from its origins to the digital age. The course will be structured around important innovations in visual technology, including: 1) the pre-history and invention of photography, 2) pre-cinematic moving pictures (Anschütz), 3) the invention of cinema (Skladanowsky Bros.), 4) sound and color innovations, 5) video, digital, and installation work. The aim of the course is to provide an historical overview of visual culture in which the radical shifts inaugurated by new technologies are examined in terms of their aesthetic, philosophical, and political impact. In the German context these shifts have been examined by important theoreticians of visual culture (most notably Arnheim, Balácz, Benjamin, Kracauer, and Flusser) whose work has changed the way we think about our relation to images. Practitioners in the German sphere have been no less influential: from Ottomar Anschütz's pre-cinematic experiments with moving pictures to the very first public demonstration of cinematic technology (the Skladanowskys' bioscope, one month before the Lumières' first show) to the avant-garde animation of the Weimar period; from the narrative and design innovations of the Expressionist filmmakers to the rich and varied independent films of the New German Cinema to the radical documentarians of the past decade. By providing students with an understanding of German innovations in and responses to new technologies this course will ground readings of particular works historically. In broad terms, class discussion will consider questions such as: What is the aesthetic status of the photographic image in relation to painting? What is the ontological status of the photograph as a chemical imprint of light? How do these new technologies lend themselves to political action? How is the spectator differently constructed by these technologies? In what way is the still image integral to the moving image-and what implications do these have for our perception of time? What is the new role of the image in mass, consumer culture (subversive or complicit)? How do the formal and technical affordances of the film-based image contribute to the construction of national, race, and gender identities, to spectator desires, and to new aesthetic categories? Readings will be available in German and in English. Class discussion will be in English.","3 Credits"
"German (GER)","GER 537","Photography, Race, Genocide","This course explores the role of photography in the context of the racialized politics of genocides and their aftermaths. The course aims to critically examine photographic evidence of genocidal violence, revealing the long shadow of modern genocides from colonialism, to the Holocaust, the Armenian, Cambodian, Rwandan genocides, to the present. At the intersection of modern constructs of race as they culminate in genocidal violence, the course investigates the political and ethical potential of photography. Topics include: definitions of genocide; modern genocides; colonialism and the concept of race; the origins of photography; photography in literature and film; the civil contract of photography; the ethics of testimonies; atomic light; commemoration and the aftermath of genocides; race after technology.","3 Credits"
"German (GER)","GER 538","German Expansionism, War & Violence: From the Seven Years' War to the War in Afghanistan","The course explores the various intersections between domestic politics and sociocultural developments and policies of martial brinksmanship, spatial expansion, and policies of ethnic cleansing and genocide. The course traces change over time with respect to ideas and practices of ethnic cleansing and genocide from the seven Years' War and the division and absorption of large portions of the former Polish state by Prussia in the late eighteenth century all the way to today, when racist reverse-colonialist notions of ""white genocide"" are being promoted by terrorist (and only recently uncovered) subsections of the German armed forces. Topics include: Pre-nationalist expansion in the late eighteenth century; the beginnings of German nationalist and racist discourse; imperialist and racialist settlement policies within the German Empire in the second half of the nineteenth century; global racialized policies of space, expansion and genocide in Africa and Asia during the age of imperialism; genocide and mass death during the First World War; Nazi ideology and genocide; genocidal fantasies in post-1945 Germany.","3 Credits"

"Greek (GREEK)","GREEK 520","Greek Mythography","This graduate seminar focuses on ancient Greek mythographic authors from the beginnings of the genre (6th C.B.C.E.) to the Roman period.GREEK 520Greek Mythography (3) This graduate seminar focuses on the ancient Greek mythographic authors from the beginnings of the genre in the sixth century B.C.E. to the Roman period. We shall define ""mythography"" simply as the prose exposition of mythic narratives (the most well-known Greek mythographer is Apollodorus, whose first-century C.E. ""Bibliotheca"" is consulted regularly by students of myth; some of the earlier practitioners include Hellanicus and Pherecydes). The seminar will consider selected readings in the theory of myth, alongside which we will examine in detail and evaluate the content of sources of the mythographers' writings. Some of these provide quite outlandish variants on known myths or bizarre stories otherwise unknown. Through a series of case studies of particular mythic stories, we shall place these texts in literary and cultural relief by seeking to understand how they interact with the more well-known mythic genres of Greece such as epic, lyric, and tragedy. We will also probe the borders of what we call ""mythography"" by examining other prose texts not normally associated with the genre, such as Herodotus' Histories or even philosophical texts such as Plato or Aristotle. In addition, since much of the material we will treat is in a fragmentary state, we will try our hands at reconstructing both texts and myths that survive in only incomplete form. Some attention will also be given to the Latin mythographic tradition (e.g. Hyginus and others) which is mostly, or perhaps wholly, dependent upon earlier or contemporary Greek mythography.","3 Credits"

"Higher Education (HIED)","HIED 515","Foundations of Educational Research","Students read the philosophical foundations of education research, study how philosophies influence methodologies, and analyze current educational problems. This course is designed for students entering doctoral programs in the College of Education. Our students are studying to become education researchers within a highly politicized environment. For example, particular definitions of education research and government policies that favor some types of research practices over others provide opportunities for and set limits upon the work of education researchers. Public controversies likewise contribute to challenges faced by education researchers who find their work affirmed or discounted by particular definitions and policies. In order to explore these controversies and to allow students to begin identifying their own ""positionality"" with regard to research, this course begins with a reading of the history and philosophies of education research (primarily focusing on the United States). The course goals are: -     to identify underlying assumptions of competing forms of social inquiry, each determined to uncover new knowledge; -     to bring those assumptions to bear on education research in chosen fields of study; and -     to begin to develop one's own positions in order to direct further study and research. Specifically, through instructor facilitation and group discussions, students will come to understand major philosophical perspectives that permeate and drive research methodologies in education: positivism, postpositivism, interpretivism, critical theory, poststructuralism, and pragmatism. These understandings allow students to recognize the methodological assumptions that inform published research studies and to discover how methodologies might inform the research they wish to conduct as students and practitioners. Although the course is not required by any particular doctoral program in the College of Education, it is suggested for students who consider research important to their future careers and who see benefits in exploring the methodological options available.","3 Credits/Maximum of 999"

The on-line experiences are aimed at applying the readings, obtaining hands-on experience in analyzing data, and developing reporting skills. Each Unit lists supplementary readings and weblinks where you can find additional information to explore the topic in greater depth. The course has linkages to the other courses in the Institutional Research Certificate program. For example, the opening weeks of HI ED 840 expand upon some of the assessment and evaluation readings and materials covered in selected units of the Foundations course (HI ED 801). Both this assessment course and the course on Studying Students and Student Affairs (HI ED 802) draw upon and discuss relevant literature and theories of student outcomes. Persistence models and theories referred to in these courses are relevant also to Enrollment Management and Forecasting (HI ED 860). The Research Design course (HI ED 830), with its emphasis on measurement issues and survey research, provides an analytical foundation for all these other IR courses. HI ED 840 summarizes the best of what we know about assessing student outcomes. Few topics are more complicated than outcomes assessment. The needs of students and the areas of their learning vary highly among institutions and degree programs. Students are diverse and the dimensions of the learning processes in American Higher Education are extremely complex. Likewise, assessing student performance is complex and hence difficult to summarize. Moreover, before we travel into the real content of assessment, we need to place our journey within a context, and within an environment that is heavily shaping what we do. Thus, before we focus on evaluation academic programs and assessing student outcomes, we will examine accountability, accreditation, and performance reporting. In recent years, evidence of student outcomes has become one of the key indicators of institutional effectiveness, especially as it is viewed by accrediting associations and many state higher education governing boards.","3 Credits"

"History (HIST)","HIST 522","History and Social Theory","The course examines the possible use of social theory by historians and explores how theory could inform historical writing. It provides an outline of canonical theoretical perspectives on modernity, class, race, gender, nationalism, totalitarianism, and the public sphere. Students will learn to navigate between theoretical perspectives that differ in the answers they give to fundamental questions, along several continuums: from emphasizing material processes as shaping human history to prioritizing the power of ideas; from accrediting the autonomous free will of humans to ascribing more influence to constraints set by social structures; from considering human history a sphere of endless conflicts to seeing it as a site where consensus and harmony are gradually built; from recognition of the existence of objective social reality to the acceptance of merely various subjective points of view; from the explicit ambition to make theory a tool for advancing certain political goals to an ambition to be politically neutral. Various scholars provide different answers to these questions. While analyzing them the course addresses, in particular, the following questions: What are some of the strengths and weaknesses in each of these positions? How are particular ways of theoretical thinking related to the specific social positions and biographies of the theorists? How have the foundations of each of these views changed over time?","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 523","The History of Colonialism and Mass Death","Over 100 million people were victims of mass killings, including genocide, in the 20th century. And yet, episodes like the Holocaust were not the first instances of state-sponsored mass death; on the contrary, mass killings and mass death have been a distinguishing feature of colonialism and its aftermaths for at least the last five centuries. How and why did these acts and processes occur? What forces caused humans to kill others on a massive scale? How have slower or less sudden processes-like death via slavery or disease-been reinterpreted and debated as foundational to genocide? What do these episodes reveal about the nature of race, religion, colonialism, technology, and modernity?HIST 523is a graduate seminar that gives students an overview of the key literatures, methodologies, and debates in the historical literature on colonialism and mass killings, from genocide to epidemiological collapse, from the fifteenth century to the present. Its broad temporal framing and comparative framework reflects debates over the place of violence in European expansion in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, while also allowing for more subsequent, more local mass killings in places where colonization retreated. Before delving into specific historical examples, we will explore definitions of colonialism, mass death, and genocide. The course is then organized chronologically and examines episodes across a broad geographical spectrum, including early modern France, the early Columbian New World, the 19th century American West, 19th century Australia, Congo and Namibia during the ""Scramble for Africa,"" East Asia in the early-mid 20th century, 1980s Guatemala, and the Darfur Genocide of the early 2000s. It familiarizes students with the re-reading of colonial and post-colonial histories since the coining of the term 'genocide' in 1944, by Raphael Lemkin, and the debates that the application of the term outside of Europe, outside of the Holocaust, have engendered. Students will be prepared to: teach on the history of mass death, mass killings, and genocide outside of Europe; more efficiently read and review academic texts; and find and interpret primary sources. This course is open to students across departments, and highly recommended for students minoring in Holocaust and Genocide Studies.","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 524","Deviance, Crime and Madness in Modern Europe","Historiography of deviance, crime, and madness in Europe from the late-18th century to the present.HIST 524Deviance, Crime and Madness in Modern Europe (3) Historians and social scientists have shown that societies have persistently established certain standards and ideals for human conduct and being. At the same time, the natural variation in human phenotypes has meant that individual, groups, and institutions within these societies have been faced with those deviating from these norms. The deviations may sometimes present themselves physically (e.g., in the form of a somatic lesion or disability), intrapersonally (e.g., in eccentric thinking or affect), or interpersonally (e.g., in criminal or anti-social conduct). As historians, anthropologists, and other have demonstrated, while there are noteworthy continuities in how these deviations have often been manifested (e.g., seizures accompanying epilepsy), there have been considerable differences across time and place in how deviance has been expressed, perceived, understood, and handled. This seminar examines this constellation of problems as they have emerged in Europe since the 18th century. Posing, as they do, complex human problems, the historical study of deviance, crime, and madness requires paying attention to the scholarly contributions of multiple disciplines beyond the field of history. Thus, the course will attend to both social theory and historiography. Each week, readings from social theory will be paired with a historical work, in order to bring broad theoretical analysis and empirical disciplinary research more deliberately into conversation with one another. Some examples of the course readings include Emile Durkheim's On Suicide, Erving Goffman's Stigma: Notes on the Management of a Spoiled Identity, Janet Oppenheim's ""Shattered Nerves: Doctors, Patients, and Depression in Victorian England,"" Norbert Elias' The Civilizing Process, Reviel Netz's Barbed Wire: An Ecology of Modernity, and Jan Gross' Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland. Weekly topics will center on key social processes and prominent conceptual frameworks: social control, self-control, marginalization, pathologization, criminalization and de-criminalization, representation, punishment, extermination, and enhancement. Students will be required to write an interdisciplinary research paper (i.e., a paper accessible to multiple scholarly audiences), calling on both theoretical and empirical scholarship from various disciplines. The course will culminate in a seminar conference in which students will present their research and field questions and comments.","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 525","Imperial Borderlands in Modern Europe","This course provides students with an overview of the processes of constructing borders in a variety of forms, ethnic, religious, trade, and linguistic, in a European imperial context.HIST 525Imperial Borderlands in Modern Europe (3) This course exposes students to the latest developments in colonial studies and new paradigms for considering European imperial history in terms of its borderlands. Using the methodological tools applied in recent years to the history of Western colonial empires, this course expands the scope of European history to encompass the complex interaction between the conquered peoples and their rulers by broadening imperial history to include the study of ethnic and religious differences that emerged from the European encounter with peoples whose cultures differed profoundly from their own. In particular, the material covered in this course will build an awareness among students of the role of states, and especially imperial states, in confronting the polyethnic/multinational character of populations they sought to rule. The theoretical and historiographical works assigned will focus on how imperial European states crafted or erased cultural differences and how borderlands posed particular challenges in these endeavors. Building on these insights, students will gain an awareness of imperial policies and conceptions of colonial rule and of the impact of imperial domination on colonial peoples. Students will learn to recognize and identify the means by which Imperial rule brought irreversible changes to the way of life of the borderlands peoples, who adapted to and resisted imperial rule by a variety of means that they had at hand. Such an approach will yield an awareness of the methods by which historians formulate questions, choose sources, use theory to interpret the material they collect, and the variety of rhetorical and other means available to historians to present findings. Students will conduct their own analyses of scholarship by reflecting on the assigned readings and presenting their thoughts and evaluations in the form of weekly critiques and a final paper. This will be invaluable in helping students to acquire the necessary methodological and theoretical tools to formulate questions for their own research projects. This course fulfills the requirement of a topical graduate course in History. It is open to students within and outside of the History Department.","3 Credits"

"History (HIST)","HIST 530","History of Science in the Early Modern World","This course exposes students to the current state of scholarship from the standpoint of historical, legal, sociological, and literary analyses of science in the early modern period. The inadequacy of long-accepted notions of ""science"" and ""modernization"" to describe the rapid changes of scientific thought in the early modern era require students to assess the specific value given to such notions by the state, religion, and society in specific cultural and historical contexts. The seminar will also explore the reconceptualization of society and nature in the early modern period and the way in which discoveries in natural philosophy inspired those changes. The exchanges between European and non-European centers of authority during the early modern period helped to shape many of these disputes and scholars' current interpretive frameworks. In particular, we will challenge triumphal narratives of the Scientific Revolution by examining the ways in which geography and local context affected ideas about the natural world, the role of gender in knowledge-making, and how non-elite and artisanal practices also contributed to the creation of early science. A focus throughout the course will be on how the exchanges between European and non-European intellectual communities shaped contemporary understanding of the natural world. The seminar is intended for graduate students in history and related fields who are preparing for the field in Early Modern studies.

Ranging from the late medieval to early twentieth century, the course will focus attention on the early modern period. Inspired by the writings of Ernst Kantorowicz, Norbert Elias, Michel Foucault, Pierre Bourdieu, and Judith Butler, among others, historians have demonstrated that bodies are not exempt from social, cultural, or ideological regimes of power. As a metaphor for the body politic or an instrument of power, the corporeal order is shown to have physical, social, symbolic, and political effects. As historians continue to demonstrate, the body has a history: which involves health, sickness and food, gestures and movement, sartorial codes and sumptuary regulations, gender taboos and sexual prohibitions. Studies of the body demand a multidisciplinary perspective. Thus, this course explores how historians have drawn upon visual as well as textual sources, and crossed disciplinary boundaries in order to better appreciate the entire range of bodily representations in the past.","3 Credits"

Methodologically, this course exposes students to a range of historical subfields, such as social history, cultural history, political history, military history, and gender history. Additionally, History 539 gives students an overview of ethnohistory, an interdisciplinary field that draws on techniques and sources from History and Anthropology. By studying ethnohistory, historians will become better acquainted with cultural anthropology and archaeology. This seminar introduces students to major questions, themes, and problems in Native American history. These include: How can we study pre-colonial Indigenous history? What impact did colonization have on the Americas? How did Indians, Europeans, and Africans attempt to navigate cultural differences? How did the enslavement of Indigenous peoples and Africans impact race in North America? How do Native-centered histories transform our understanding of the American past?","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 541","War in the Early Modern and Modern World","The study of the causes, conduct, and political, social, diplomatic, cultural, and economic consequences of war from 1500 to the present.HIST 541War in the Early Modern and Modern World (3) This course offers an introduction to the complexity of war in the early modern (1400-1850) and modern world (1850 to the present). Since war has been experienced across the entire world, the course will draw readings and examples from North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It brings together the two major approaches to the study of war, both the traditional emphasis on the battlefield and the more recent consideration of both the battlefront and the political, social, economic, and cultural homefronts. Specifically, this course considers the various methodologies that have shaped the ways in which historians have asked and answered such fundamental questions as how and why wars start, have been averted, and ended. The study of military theory provides the intellectual framework that shaped the study and conduct of war at specific periods of history and in specific cultural context. The evolution of a nation's military theory over time reflects the impact of changes in technology, the changing social composition of its armed forces, the strength of the economic support the national government will supply, and much more. Thus, this course considers issues relevant to armies (technology, soldier experience in battle), to the government (laws of war, revolutions in military affairs, military doctrine, war and national identity), and to the people (issues relating to race, class, and gender; antiwar activism, popular literature) for a fuller understanding of the overarching impact of war in the modern and early modern world.","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 542","American Borderlands","This course provides graduate students with an introduction to the field of American borderlands studies. It devotes a great deal of coverage to the most important of the nation's international frontiers, the U.S.-Mexico border, by detailing the various positions of Native Americans, Anglos, Asians, and Mexicans as they struggled over competing visions of an American future. But the course also attends to other major American frontiers, including the Atlantic littoral, the Canadian border, and the Pacific rim; it also examines all these in international context. In order to get a broad survey of the state of the field, we will examine how cross-cultural encounters shaped policy, changed the landscape, and heightened racial tensions. Using a variety of texts-documentary and feature films, magazine and newspaper articles, travelers' accounts, academic monographs and articles, and popular literature-we will explore a range of topics: territorial expansion, Native dispossession, racial formation and anxiety, Mexican, Asian, and Canadian migration and labor, and cultural change and negotiation. The course will begin with a close examination of the political, economic, and military conflicts that defined America's eastern, southern, northern, and western boundaries and then follow a series of selected historical events that led up to the current political and cultural debates that continue in the borderlands today. Drawing on these items, we will ultimately reflect on how past and present collide in all the nation's borderlands, shaping the United States in countless ways.","3 Credits"

"History (HIST)","HIST 547","Slavery in the Americas","Slavery in South America, the Caribbean, and North America from 16th century European colonization through the 19th century abolition movement.HIST 547Slavery in the Americas (3) This course provides a broad exploration of slavery in the Americas from the beginning of European colonization to abolition. From the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century, Spanish, Portuguese, British, and French colonists in the Americas created the largest slave societies the world has ever known. Slaves in the New World produced tropical commodities such as sugar, tobacco, cotton, and coffee that, in turn, contributed to the foundation of capitalist and consumer societies in the Atlantic world. The staple crops produced by slaves were among the first goods to transform elite luxuries into common necessities. The Age of Revolution was a watershed in the history of slavery in the Americas, transforming the terms of struggle between slaves and slaveholders, of debate about slavery, of the ideology of slavery. While the Age of Revolution catalyzed a century-long process of abolition, it also began a new period in the expansion of slavery. Slaveholders developed new policies, practices, and doctrines to reconcile slavery and liberalism. The adoption of modern technology and industrial techniques of production resulted in dramatic increases in the productivity and exploitation of slaves, as well as the wealth and power of slaveholders. The simultaneous growth of slavery and antislavery heightened political divisions over slavery and made its destruction a protracted struggle marked by slave rebellion and civil war as well as landmark acts of state. This course investigates the origins of slavery, race, and abolitionism; transformations in plantation production, the culture of Africans in the Americas, and the ideologies of slavery; and the relationships among slavery, liberalism, capitalism, and modernity. Students will apply a range of concepts from the human sciences, such as creolization, ideology, and human geography, to major problems in the history of slavery.","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 548","Space and Place in American History","This course offers a survey of American history from roughly the fifteenth to twentieth centuries. Students will read and discuss studies employing the lenses of physical space and place to examine the changes in the American landscape over time. They will learn to read the built environment as an historical text, assess how changes in landscape and spatial practice reveal larger shifts in social and economic structures, and identify the multiple practices of spatial arrangement that existed among diverse groups who came to make up the United States. They will be encouraged to recognize, identify, and apply the social scientific theories of ""the spatial turn"" and the tools of spatial analysis to place. At the conclusion of the course, students will come to recognize the way analysis of place can reveal the values and power relations in society. They will articulate the importance of physical space in shaping social interactions and how that has changed over time, while also achieving a better understanding of the diverse characteristics of peoples, societies, and institutions in U.S. history.","3 Credits"

"History (HIST)","HIST 557","The History of the Modern Middle East","This course introduces graduate students to key historiographical and methodological literatures and debates in the field of modern Middle Eastern history. Drawing on a variety of historical approaches and methods from related disciplines, we analyze the transformation of the Middle East in the modern era as part of broader global processes. The rise of capitalism and the incorporation of the Middle East into the world economy led to wide-ranging transformations in agriculture, urbanization, the creation of new social classes, and migration within and to the region. The expansion of imperial, colonial, and national states occurred congruent with the emergence of mass politics, new technologies, and new public spaces. All of the above developments contributed to changing intercommunal relations, new gender roles, and a reassessment of the role of religion in political and social life. Graduate students will thus acquire deep knowledge about the history of the region while at the same time developing comparative skills and a broader understanding of the Middle East within world history.","3 Credits"

"History (HIST)","HIST 567","Revolution and Counter-revolution in Modern Latin America","Latin American colonial history was defined by exploitation for profit; the efficiency of state control over Indigenous and Afro-descendant populations established economic profit or loss. In the face of independence, abolition, and widespread immigration, racial hierarchy and exploitation continued to shape modern Latin America, but often under a fictive constitutional promise of equality, citizenship, and democracy. In the nineteenth century much of Latin America experienced the rise of caudillos, military strong men, and dictators who often rule through a limited or truncated form of democracy but come to represent the interests of the political, industrial, and landed elite who consolidate their control over much of Latin America in the early twentieth century. In response to this control, we see a rise of popular revolution throughout twentieth century Latin America. Some succeed while others fail; they include national and regional movements, they are shaped by labor, agriculture, populism, democracy, nationalism, socialism, communism, and military uprising. We later see-often but not always in direct response-a conservative backlash in the form of military dictatorships, neo-colonial and neo-liberal economies, torture, disappearance, murder, and anti-communist fervor driven by Cold-War ideology. We will examine these events through various lenses: that of participants, through analysis of regional and national outcomes, and through the intervention of global powers. We will ask what social, political, and/or racial conditions led to revolutionary situations? How successful were revolutionary leaders at shaping policies, administrations, and nations? What did revolutionaries seek to accomplish and what were the outcomes of their reforms? Conversely, what did counterrevolutionaries seek to accomplish and what were the outcomes of their reforms? We cannot address every ""revolution"" or every conservative backlash that occurred in modern Latin America. By addressing these themes in Cuba, Mexico, Central America, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, we will emphasize forms of revolution, nationalism, ""bureaucratic-authoritarian."" state formation, imperialism, agrarian reform, immigration, industrialization, labor movements, and citizenship.","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 568","Medicine, Science, and Technology in Latin American History","This graduate course explores the history of medicine, science, and technology in early modern Latin America and Iberia, integrating interdisciplinary approaches and local/global contexts. It is designed to give students an overview of some of the key historiographical debates and research in these fields for Latin America and Iberia, and to provide a basic familiarity with the forms that this field of historical/interdisciplinary inquiry has taken in recent years. Some of the themes that we will explore are the role of empire building in shaping medical, scientific, and technological knowledge; how ""non-Western"" (indigenous, African, Asian, and mixed race) healers, artisans, and scientists innovated, developed, and recreated their practices and societal roles under colonial rule; the historical development of public health in Latin America; and the interactions between global processes of Western knowledge production and local-level multi-ethnic Latin American knowledge production. This course will be of interest to those studying colonial Latin America, those who wish to understand the colonial legacies of issues important to modern Latin America research topics, those interested in the early modern era in a comparative and/or global perspective, and those who wish to prepare for the Latin America or Early Modern World fields of their comprehensive exams.","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 569","Colonial Latin American History","HIST 569gives students an overview of key literatures, methodologies, and debates in the historiography of Latin America (the writing of Latin American history), from the 1490s to the Independence period (mostly, but by no means solely, the 1820s). Its primary focus is Spanish America and Portuguese Brazil, especially Iberian interactions with indigenous American and Africans/African-descended people. But some attention is given to all regions of the Americas and to roles played by British, French, and other colonizers. Chronologically, it is a prequel toHIST 570(but not an official prerequisite). The course comprises five sections, each based on an historical sub-field and its historiography within the larger field: (1) the indigenous civilizations of the Americas and their responses to European invasion, including the shift from traditional Eurocentric Conquest narratives to the New Conquest History; (2) the political and economic institutions, as well as the culture, of Spanish and Portuguese colonization; (3) the changes and continuities in indigenous civilizations during the colonial centuries (usually termed ""Ethnohistory,"" and explored more fully inHIST 571); (4) the history of trans-Atlantic slavery and the experience of African-descended peoples in Colonial Latin America; and (5) a sub-field that will vary according to instructor, examples being the history of science and medicine in the region, the history of gender and sexuality, and the history of religious change (or ""the Spiritual Conquest"").","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 570","Latin American History, 1800-Present","This seminar gives students an overview of central literatures and debates in the historiography of Latin America (the writing of Latin American history) and the Americas more broadly, from approximately to 1800 to the present. Its framing reflects the chronology of mainland Spanish American Independence, but it reaches backwards and outwards as needed. It looks to prior Andean and Haitian bids for self-determination and subsequent exports and imports - of empire, capital, people commodities, science, and instruments of terror - to and from the United States and Africa. It connects those nodes by tracing continuities in political, social, and environmental relationships, and by identifying the ways that peoples in the region (in the Caribbean, Mexico and Central America, Colombia and the Andes, Brazil and the Southern Cone) have thought and acted their way out of colonialisms. Chief among the seminar's goals is the preparation of graduate students to teach post-1800 Latin American History to undergraduates. Students will develop a grasp of the field's key historiographical developments, and think about new ways to teach a subject that many - but not all - North American undergraduates meet with stereotypes. Graduate students of other historical geographies and from other disciplines are welcome too, given that it is also designed to survey approaches to thinking historically after 1800, to question assumptions that those methodologies make, and to address the politics of researching and writing a post-colonial history of a place that has always been ""modern,"" where ""Latin America"" came into being as a means of anticipating questions crucial to past and present imperialisms, global histories, and politics","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 571","Latin American Ethnohistory","HIST 571gives students an overview of key literatures, methodologies, and debates in the historiography of Latin American ethnohistory, from the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries. ""Ethnohistory"" is defined here as the historical study of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The course comprises four sections, each based on an historical sub-field and its historiography: (1) the indigenous civilizations of the Americas in the pre-Contact and Contact periods, primarily fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, including but not necessarily limited to the civilizations of the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas; (2) indigenous responses to European invasion, with particular attention to regions of Spanish and Portuguese activity - and including the historiographical development of the New Conquest History, with attention also given to regions where colonies were not established; (3) the indigenous experience of Spanish and Portuguese colonization, and indigenous contributions to new colonial-era societies, including changes and continuities in indigenous civilizations during the colonial centuries - and including the historiographical development of the New Philology); and (4) the indigenous experience of the long Independence period, taking the seminar to a point in the nineteenth century, as determined by the instructor.","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 572","Race and Nation in Modern Latin America","From initial colonial contact, Latin America represents a site of violent conquest by European colonizers over indigenous populations and exploitation of both African and indigenous labor; white control over black and brown bodies was at the very core of colonial economic success or failure. In turn, racial hierarchy and exploitation define both colonial and modern Latin American history. Our focus is not the overall study of race and slavery throughout Latin American history. Instead we will examine the role of race in Latin American nation-building following independence through the age of twentieth century nationalism. As the ideas of scientific racism swept Europe and the United States in the nineteenth century, the United States established economic, and at times military, dominance over much of Latin America from the neo-colonial period of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Increasingly, as cultural and economic ties were broken with the Iberian empires-even in the case of Spain's last American colonies, Cuba and Puerto Rico-Latin American elite sought modernity through trade with and cultural borrowing from the United States and Europe. In response to the scientific racist ideology that in the US led to segregation, Jim Crow, convict lease systems, lynching, and widespread disenfranchisement, Latin American elite consciously engaged these racist ideas as they granted or restricted non-white populations access to their rights as citizens. Nineteenth century luminaries such as Cuban revolutionary José Marti, Argentine journalist and politician Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and even Venezuelan military and political leader Simón Bolívar had introduced radical ideas on race and citizenship. In the first half of the twentieth century Latin American intellectuals famously built on those ideas by embracing, renegotiating, and/or rejecting North American racist ideologies-often all within the same work-as they optimistically and proudly recognized and rehabilitated the place of the nonwhite, indigenous, mestizo, and mulatto populations into their national narratives. We will focus on three of the best known of these authors (Mexican Jose Vasconcelos, Cuban Fernando Ortiz, and Brazilian Gilberto Freyre) as well as scholarship that will help us contextualize their works, and allow us to better understand the broader theme of race in modern Latin America. The object here is to consider how the subject of race-in large part defined by the role of Afro-Latin Americans, the indigenous, mestizo, and mulattos-is situated in relation to broader considerations of nation, power, violence, and identity. The goal of the course is to lay the groundwork for an interdisciplinary understanding of modern Latin America and the modern black Atlantic: To consider the consequences of colonization, slavery, and the slave trade, both historically and contemporarily, on modern intellectual formations and institutions.","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 573","Empire & Society Latin Amer","HIST 573gives students an overview of key literatures, methodologies, and debates in the historiography of empire and society in Latin American history, fifteenth to nineteenth centuries. The course comprises five sections, each based on an historical sub-field and its historiography: (1) the empires and societies of the Americas in the pre-Contact and Contact periods, primarily that of the Maya, Aztecs, and Incas; (2) the culture and society of Spanish and Portuguese imperialism in Iberia and the Americas (3) the culture and society of the Spanish conquistadors, including roles played by indigenous and black conquistadors; (4) the impact on the Americas of Spanish and Portuguese imperialism in East Asia, and the cultural and social ramifications of trans-Pacific exchanges during the colonial centuries; and (5) the comparative history of imperialism in the Americas by other European powers, most notably the British, Dutch, and French, including the differing experiences of indigenous and African-descended peoples.

"History (HIST)","HIST 580","Early Modern Asia","This course offers a foundation in early modern Asia from roughly the fifteenth to mid-nineteenth centuries. Students will examine the constitution of centralized and bureaucratic empires, ideological movements, and practices associated with Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hindu thought, and the formation of syncretic socio-cultural spheres in different parts of Asia. Through an exploration of key political, cultural, and intellectual developments in Asia, students will assess Asia's place in the global network of thought, commerce, and exchange. Central to this analysis is how such contact with overland and maritime cultures deeply affected mainstream Asian societies. By tracing such interactions, students will be encouraged to recognize, identify, and apply the roles of frontier and borderlands in the creation and reification of identity and culture in different parts of Asia. Through this multifaceted approach to Asian history, students will come to recognize the strategic role of Asia within the pan-Eurasian sphere of interactions while also achieve a better understanding of the diverse characteristics of Asian peoples, societies, and institutions in history.","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 581","Modern China","Primarily a reading seminar, this course focuses on Chinese history from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, emphasizing the profound ways that the Qing empire, Republican China, and then the People's Republic changed through numerous social, cultural, economic, and political revolutions. In particular, the course investigates transitions from the late imperial period through the Revolution, the Warlord period, the Nanjing Decade, Second World War, the Civil War, and the establishment of the socialist China. Students will examine the changing role of women in Chinese society to the changing relationship of humans to environment, as well as exploring the multiple approaches Chinese historians have taken to reading and presenting historical work, including economic, political, social, and cultural history; social, cultural, economic, and political revolutions; the consolidation of communism; and the impact of successive political movements on China and the Chinese peoples.","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 582","Women and Gender in Modern Chinese History","Examines the historical literature on women and gender in late imperial and twentieth century China.HIST 582Women and Gender in Modern Chinese History (3) The roles of women and men have undergone major shifts in late imperial and modern China, affecting all aspects of daily life. Just the titles used to describe feminine ideals give an indication of these shifts - from the ""talented women"" of the late imperial period to the ""new women"" and ""modern girls"" of the early twentieth century to the ""iron ladies"" of the Communist period to the ""factory girls"" of the new millennia. Masculine ideals, too, have shifted, from the literary scholar-official of late imperial China to the patriotic worker of the Mao years to the entrepreneurial party member of the late twentieth century. But beyond the ideals, the day-to-day lives of Chinese people have been fundamentally altered as well, changing the way people relate to family and to society. This course examines the historical literature on these shifts from the late imperial period to the present. Misperceptions and stereotypes about Chinese gender roles and, in particular, the status of women are widespread. In the past several decades, historians of China have sought to place our understanding of these topics on firmer historical ground by exploring topics from homosexuality and law in imperial China to widowhood and the imperial cult of female chastity to new marriage practices in post-economic reform village China and, in doing so, to undermine the ""orientalism"" that informed, for instance, investigations of footbinding and the ""women's quarters."" Through a wide range of readings, this course will introduce students to the major works and topics in the field of Chinese women's and gender history, including: women and family, women's legal history, gender and nationalism, ""new women"" (xin fun&uuml;), gender and revolution, gender and demographics, gender and labor, women's liberation, and love and sexuality. Students will be expected to demonstrate their familiarity with the major themes and topics for Chinese women's and gender history through discussion and written work.","3 Credits"
"History (HIST)","HIST 583","Rebellion, Revolution and Nation in China","A research seminar, this course focuses on rebellion and revolution in Chinese history from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. In particular, the course investigates not only the myriad forms of revolution experienced in China including the 1911 Revolution, the Warlord period, the Nanjing Decade, Second World War, the Civil War, and the Cultural Revolution, it seeks to see these through the lens of the political ideologies such as nationalism, anarchism, communism, and feminism. Students will examine the manner in which the tide of rising expectations predicated the social and economic motivations lingering in the more overt political demands. Understanding the dramatic shifts in Chinese culture as well as its relationship to global politics will shape much of the seminar's focus.","3 Credits"

"Homeland Security (HLS)","HLS 540","Comparative Homeland Security and Related Methods","The need for a coordinated, international response to security threats to citizens and societies since 9/11 has never been greater. Homeland security in the U.S. is a specific subset of national security that focuses on a risk-informed mission space, addressing it by law-enforcement - as opposed to defense - concepts and capabilities, and working across the country and around the world to keep the American nation safe and secure. Homeland security and civil security policies and strategies to make nations secure and resilient against terrorist as well as all-hazards threats were established not only in the U.S. but also in many other countries in the world, based on the need to work with international partners. This course provides students with information and skills to undertake international comparative analysis of civil security threats and ways to address those threats. Crucial aspects of this course will include a comparative examination of select topics, such as: critical infrastructure protection; cybersecurity; use of armies in homeland security; public-private partnerships; security governance; as well as the creation of ""security"" as public good and its ""delivery"" to the citizens in different countries, along with U.S. collaboration with other nations. The course is rooted in the research focus of civil security. This refers to an all-hazards approach to identifying and closing security gaps based on a mission-centered, comprehensive approach (prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, recovery - plus transversal aspects such as resilience) that is tuned to end-user requirements, and speaks to technological and societal aspects (including ethical and legal issues). Civil security focuses on both 'all of government' and 'whole of community.' It includes dual-use aspects and civil-military interaction in crisis management, but excludes military-only aspects. The course places an emphasis on U.S.-European Union (EU) comparisons based on a related U.S.-EU implementing arrangement, and covers other world regions also. It will further scrutinize comparative analysis of emergent threats and challenges by focusing on risk cultures and security cultures in different countries. Moreover, the course will critically assess - across different countries - citizens perceptions of homeland security and public acceptance of the use of security technology for surveillance and other purposes, across different countries. The comparative perspective cannot be taught without investigating methods and analytical approaches. Lessons will therefore include comparative examination of research-related methods as well as practical methods - such as risk and vulnerability assessment - used in the policy sector, and how and why those differ across countries.","3 Credits"
"Homeland Security (HLS)","HLS 558","Whole-Community Disaster Preparedness","Whole-community disaster preparedness describes a fairly wide range of issues of relevance to the homeland security mission space that essentially encompasses aspects of emergency management, such as ""ensuring resilience to disasters"" as one of the core missions of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - since after 9/11 and the creation of DHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) came under the roof of DHS, forming one of its so-called department components. Academically and professionally, disaster psychology contributes an important perspective to emergency management within an all-hazards and a whole-of-community approach to homeland security: Based on a general civil security perspective, it addresses the way people perceive and experience disasters, the way they react to them, and the way they recover from them. Within this context, the course explores the psychological impact of disasters and terrorist attacks on victims, families, rescuers, and society and methods of reducing negative psychological effects. Topics covered include the perception and communication of risk, psychological effects of traumatic events, and psychological interventions to reduce harmful psychological effects of disasters.","3 Credits"

This one-semester internship is designed to provide real world experience in the Homeland Security Enterprise. The course is an elective for students in the Intercollege Master of Professional Studies in Homeland Security (iMPS-HLS) program. Internships can be part-time or full-time and paid or unpaid. Interns may earn 3-6 credits. The number of credits a student can earn will be based on the character of the actual work performed in the internship, in particular the site-specific research project. Interns must complete at least 300 hours on the internship. This is equivalent to working 20 hours per week, although internship schedules are flexible and may be determined on an individual basis. The course includes both an internship and accompanying academic supervision and discussion. It is available to students enrolled in all options related to the program. The course is an additional offering to specialized internship programs that are in place in some iMPS-HLS options. It focuses on a comprehensive real-world experience of the Homeland Security Enterprise: The internship provides real-world experience to enhance the educational experience and application of knowledge and skills acquired in the program. The accompanying academic supervision and discussion contribute to reaching the overall purpose of the course: to integrate academic and real world learning through an internship opportunity in a workplace setting. Internship activities and assignments are designed to: understand how research and studies are conducted, used, or interpreted in the Homeland Security Enterprise to inform real-world decision-making; to enhance professional development; gain career-related experiences and to provide the opportunity for real-world application of knowledge in a workplace setting; and to prepare for potential job placements. The course places students in numerous workplace and/or research settings that will allow students the opportunity to apply and integrate academic coursework within a professional setting to prepare for further job placement in the Homeland Security Enterprise. Additionally, internship activities and assignments are designed to meet individualized goals and skills, and to evaluate progress toward those competencies. Internship work will be evaluated on an on-going basis with the student intern, site supervisor, and faculty member involved in the process.","3-6 Credits/Maximum of 6"

The National Incident Management System (NIMS) and its companion policy guidance document, the National Response Framework (NRF), provide broad policy guidance for a comprehensive approach to domestic incident management to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from all hazards incidents. Familiarity with the NIMS and the NRP are essential for individuals to integrate into and be a valuable member of destructive event mitigation and response, whether disasters are natural or human-caused. Critical infrastructure, key resources, and border protection provide the framework for the nation's homeland security and defense efforts. Over eighty percent of these resources reside in the private sector. This presents a challenge to the nation, particularly in the areas of policy guidance and information sharing between the public and the private sectors.

"Homeland Security (HLS)","HLS 813","Multifaceted Approaches to Homeland Security","Preparedness and responsiveness have long been part of the law enforcement and military lexicon; however 9/11 expanded the terms' application and the number of people who hold responsibility for their implementation. The result is a growing interest surrounding the nature of the terrorist threat and how intelligence fusion is essential to prevention; the role of the military in civil society; cooperation among federal, state, and local agencies as well as the private sector in response to a catastrophic event; the importance of planning and exercises to improve the mitigation of such events. This course gives an overview of relevant perspectives and concepts related to these topics and develops a framework that demonstrates their interconnectivity. In addition to providing a conceptual understanding of key ideas, it familiarizes students with the roles played by various entities (e.g., law enforcement, intelligence organizations, the military, and federal, state, and local agencies) and the de facto framework in which they exercise their responsibilities. The course gives students an overview of intelligence and the importance of intelligence fusion as a counter-terrorism force as well as the need for collaboration among all relevant actors and the integration of actions and planning.

Emerging threats and disruptive technology is a new field of study in the homeland security enterprise, whether in academia, public, or private sector. Thus, there is very little awareness or understanding of the needed policies, analytical methodologies, and strategic planning to guide homeland security practices over the next generation. In some ways, the homeland security enterprise is operating in a knowledge void, with the potential of being surprised as new and potentially devastating threats emerge.

"Human Development and Family Studies (HDFS)","HDFS 541","Optimization of Behavioral and Biobehavioral Interventions","Evidence-based behavioral and biobehavioral interventions are used to prevent and treat health problems (e.g. school-based drug abuse prevention; smoking cessation treatment), improve educational attainment (e.g. reading improvement interventions), and promote health and well-being (e.g. parenting skills training). An intervention may be aimed at any age and delivered in any context; may be aimed at individuals, families, organizations, or communities; and may include both behavioral components and medical components such as pharmaceuticals. The purpose of this course is to enable students to understand and apply quantitative, empirical research methods for optimization of evidence-based multicomponent behavioral and biobehavioral interventions. These methods are used for two related purposes. First, they are used to obtain knowledge about what intervention components work and for whom. Second, they are used to build optimized evidence-based interventions that are not only effective, but also efficient, economical, and scalable. The methods can be used to build new interventions, improve existing interventions, or identify good approaches for implementing interventions. The course will cover a comprehensive framework for empirical development, optimization, and evaluation of evidence-based behavioral and biobehavioral interventions. Students will learn how to craft a detailed conceptual model for an intervention under development, based on existing scientific theory and literature, and the student's own ideas. A substantial amount of time in the course will be spent on experimental design for optimization trials, particularly factorial experimental designs and variations such as the fractional factorial. The emphasis will be on making the best use of available resources so as to gather the highest-quality and most relevant scientific information. Students will learn how to identify the most appropriate and efficient experimental design for an optimization trial. Practical matters, such as guarding against implementation errors when conducting an experiment in a field setting, and dealing with errors if they occur, will be reviewed. Appropriate statistical analysis of data gathered during an optimization trial will be discussed. Students will learn how use the empirical results obtained in an optimization trial as a basis for selection of the components and component levels that will make up the optimized intervention. Students will also learn how the approaches covered in this course are applicable across a broad range of intervention types and objectives, and also to determine how these approaches are applicable to optimization of interventions in the students' own individual fields of scientific endeavor.","3 Credits"

It examines such laws and regulations as they affect a representative spectrum of HR concerns, ranging from hiring and contract formation, to anti-discrimination laws and union relations, to personal privacy. The course first examines the role of culture and employment and labor law in the field of international human resources management (IHRM). Students will be asked to address how different national legal regimes affect important HR policies and practices involving the formation of compensation, firing or layoff of employees, anti-discrimination measures, works councils, and mergers and acquisitions. In addition to comparative (national) law, a growing body of ""supra-national"" regulation - much of it issued and supervised by the International Labor Organization - sets the stage for the latter weeks of the course. These lessons examine how international labor standards are created and can then adopted as part of unilaterally issued corporate codes of conduct or incorporated into bargained-for international framework agreements (between multinational companies and global union federations).

Compensation systems play a critical role in a variety of ways in creating effective and efficient organizational outcomes. The types and levels of pay are important in an organization's ability to recruit talent. Similarly the ability to retain talent, particularly in the context of competitive global markets, is related to the quality of types and levels of compensation. In this latter context, the course will connect compensation to the manner in which HRER professionals are able to support organizational strategy. The course will also provide illustrations of the primary ways in which compensation contributes to the entire talent management process. For example, the course will provide tools to understand the role equity plays in influencing employee satisfaction with pay policies and practices, and the resulting ways in which employees respond to their assessment of such circumstances. In this context students will learn how compensation policies influence employee motivation, satisfaction, and employee engagement, as well as other ways in which HR professionals respond to compensation-related issues (e.g. employees perception of unfair pay practices).","3 Credits"

"Industrial Engineering (IE)","IE 588","Nonlinear Networks","Foundation in congestion games, including elements of non-cooperative game theory, equilibrium network flows, Braess paradox, and the price of anarchy.  I E 588 Nonlinear Networks (3) This course examines the theory of congestion games, developed originally to describe flows on congested transport networks but recently embraced to model data networks. Students will learn how to formulate descriptive models of traffic and data network flows in the presence of congestion as Nash games expressed as variational inequalities (VIs).

Numerical techniques for solving Vis and MPECs will be discussed and illustrated. The course begins with an introduction to so-called system optimal network flow models that explicitly incorporate network congestion. The study of system optimal flows contains an introduction to nonlinear network optimization algorithms, including feasible direction, gradient projection, simplicial decomposition and affine scaling algorithms. Following the consideration of system optimal flows, both atomic and non-atomic network equilibrium models in the form of non-cooperative Nash games are discussed in-depth. The price of anarchy is presented as the ratio of the cost of Nash equilibrium flows to the cost of system optimal flows within the network of interest. Various theoretical bounds on the price of anarchy are derived. Numerical experiments to determine the price of anarchy are also described. The Braess paradox, wherein global congestion can increase when local capacity is added to a nonlinear network, is introduced and its relationship to the price of anarchy demonstrated. Discrete and continuous equilibrium network design models that eliminate any possibility for the Braess paradox to arise are articulated. Each such design model is shown to be equivalent to a Stackelberg game, which is a type of mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC).Mechanism design in the form of network congestion pricing to alleviate the effects of congestion is also considered and show to have an MPEC structure as well.

"Information Sciences and Technology (IST)","IST 501","Interdisciplinary Research Design for Information Sciences and Technology","An interdisciplinary introduction to graduate research design for investigating how data and information technologies are created, analyzed, and evaluated.IST 501serves as the central foundational course for graduate students who intend to conduct research in IST. Although each student may eventually focus on one or several methods discussed in the course, the College is committed to providing all of its research students an interdisciplinary mindset regarding their own and their peers' research activities. This mindset is a defining feature of IST research training. The course provides foundational information regarding three contrasting research perspectives of IST: Social Informatics, Human-Centered Design and Computational Informatics. The three perspectives are presented in an interleaved fashion, one week at a time, with gradually increasing complexity and sophistication in the methods used. The methods address requirements for, design of, and impacts of information technologies used to meet people's information needs at multiple levels of analysis, including individuals, groups, organizations, and national and global cultures. The technologies investigated are of various types, including algorithms, structured data, user interfaces, and distributed systems. Each one-week methods topic is practiced through an individual homework activity and a team project is used to provide an integrated application activity that cumulates throughout the semester. Through reading of contemporary and classic literature, demonstrations and practice with specific research techniques, and sharing and reflection on individual and team research activities, students will explore fundamental assumptions, theories and directions in contemporary research design useful to researchers in IST. The emphasis of this course is on defining and developing conceptual linkages between human behavior, the social, organizational, and cultural context of information and technology use, human experience when learning or using information and computing technologies, and the construction of information and computing technologies. The interdisciplinary research design will operate at individual, group, and other units of human, social, and organizational analysis, and across a range of information technologies.","3 Credits"
"Information Sciences and Technology (IST)","IST 503","Foundations for IST Research","Study of major methodological, normative, and theoretical issues in philosophy of science related to reserach in information sciences and technology.IST 503Foundations for IST Research (3) This course is a study of major methodological, normative, and theoretical issues in the philosophy of science related to research in information science and technology. A significant part of this course will involve coordinating issues and problems customarily associated with the philosophy of science in general with current research in information science and technology (IST) in particular. In order to achieve this coordination, the study of classical texts in the philosophy of science will be interspersed at appropriate places with lectures and topics that exhibit relevant faculty research in various IST related disciplines.The course focuses on the main arguments that have been advanced in Anglo-American philosophy of the science for the period beginning about seventy years ago up to the present. The course contradicts the view of a single unitary ""philosophy of science."" It shows a series of positions and arguments that continue to lead on to still deeper questions. Usually the student will have adopted one of the classical positions without having examines it or defended it rigorously. Readings will progress in a historical fashion through arguments that attempt to provide a justification for the truth claims of science. The course will begin with a consideration of logical positivism in its early forms, i.e. the ideas of the Vienna Circle, and the early Wittgenstein's theory of meaning. The course will go on to the writings of Karl Popper especially as found in his Logic of Scientific Discovery. Continuing the historical development, Kuhn's ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" will be considered. The discussion will then progress to the Popper-Kuhn debates involving the sophisticated falsificationists (Lakatos) and eclectic approaches like Feyerabend's. Finally, Richard Bernstein's book, Beyond Objectivism and Relativism is reviewed summarizing the debate. This final view strives to uncover the strong points in the opposing positions reviewed early in the course. Then it sets a hermeneutical position which he derives principally from the philosophy of Hans Georg Gadamer. This position amounts to a new and interesting view on how knowledge is attained in science and in life in general. The course relates the debates in the arguments in the philosophy of science to research issues in IST.","3 Credits"

This has led to the need for appropriate methods of studying information systems and technologies in their context of use. There is a growing consensus that qualitative methods offer important research opportunities for this type of study. Therefore, researchers in such fields as the information sciences and technologies, communication technologies and information systems should have an understanding of the various types of qualitative methods so that they can determine ones that are most appropriate for addressing their particular research problems. The course is complementary to quantitative methods courses, in that it addresses problems that are not amenable to those approaches. For example, studies involving very small groups, individuals, societal level concepts and others often lend themselves to qualitative research techniques.This course begins by considering research topics that lend themselves to the choice of qualitative research methods. It then proceeds to examine the steps involved in conducting qualitative research. These include: developing the research question(s); choosing a particular research method (such as ethnography, case study or action research); making decisions about approaches to data collection (such as interview or focus group) and analysis (such as coding technique); and producing and publishing the results.This course explores concrete issues that researchers have encountered in their use of qualitative methods.

"International Affairs (INTAF)","INTAF 505","Strategy, Conflict, Peace","The course teaches the principal solution concepts to the analysis of strategic interaction in static and dynamic contexts, and under incomplete information.INTAF 505Strategy, Conflict, Peace (3) The purpose of this course is to provide the analytical tools required to deal with international affairs situations that involve strategic actions - that is, actions whose outcome depends on the interaction with other decision makers. While the approach of the course is applied, with recourse to many illustrations by real examples, the primary concern of the course is with the development of the appropriate analytical tool kit to be able to deal with choice in the presence of strategic interaction with other agents. The core tool kit is provided by game theory, and this is the focus of the course. Coverage will be of the representation of games, solution concepts in static as well as dynamic games, and the role of information in games. While primary attention will be on non-cooperative strategic interaction, some results from cooperative game theory are also considered. Presentation of core analytical techniques will be in the form of lectures. Many applications will be presented by course participants. Applications are drawn from concrete examples encountered in the literature. Strong emphasis is placed on applications that are encountered by agents in international contexts. Since such international agents span the range from nations, political parties, firms, multinationals, households and firms, applications are multidisciplinary. Applications are drawn from (but not limited to): voting and agendas; reciprocity; surprise attack and disarmament; nuclear deterrence; randomization of promises and threats; sequential bargaining; time consistency; reputation; location games; partnership games; tariffs; Median Voter Theorem; political participation; contracts; guarantees; reputation and incomplete information; signaling; cheap talk; tournaments; coalition formation and the importance of stable preference-driven cooperation in an anarchic world.","3 Credits"

Among the factors considered will be the role of lobbyists, special interests and bureaucratic politics. Among the major topics covered will be national identity, the politics of national security since World War II, foreign policy formulation in China, the domestic sources of American foreign policy, case studies in buying influence, the influence of think tanks, public opinion and ethnic groups, how other countries attempt to influence American foreign policy and how domestic groups in other countries try to influence their own foreign policy. This course will be extremely useful to any student wishing to understand how governments formulate and implement foreign policy and how that has been affected by domestic politics in the past and today. Students will learn about the history of political influences on foreign policy and how that had changed over time, especially since the end of the Cold War. Students will also develop their ability to think critically and to apply that thinking to historical and present-day examples of interest groups influencing foreign policy. The course will also emphasize professional skills including the development of the student's ability to write and to make in-class presentations.","3 Credits"
"International Affairs (INTAF)","INTAF 510","Cross Cultural Conflict Resolution","Across the globe there are more laws and provisions in place to protect human beings from discrimination than at any other time in history and yet there are more incidents of conflict, intolerance, bias, and violence than ever. How are we to make sense of these two competing realities? How can we become ethical leaders in the face of such contrasts and complications? This course combines perspectives from communications, psychology, sociology, political science, law and legal studies, human rights, identity-based studies, media studies, and cultural studies to engage questions of how cultural difference and discrimination play a role in conflict and resolution. Topics to be covered are 1) how societies create inegalitarian categories of identity, 2) how those divisions create conflict, and 3) how those divisions hinder conflict resolution. The course will look at a variety of ways that societies come to categorize forms of human life according to religion, nationalism, patriarchy, ethnic identity, and other forms of social division and stereotyping. One key area we will address is the development of law and other instruments that both protect and disenfranchise vulnerable populations. We will also look at strategies for cross-cultural community development and peace building. The topics will be studied in a cross-cultural context allowing students to consider these issues from a range of global perspectives.","3 Credits"
"International Affairs (INTAF)","INTAF 511","Ethical Dimensions in Food and Agricultural Governance","Famines around the world have long made news headlines, and in recent years the news includes a discussion of the so-called ""diseases of affluence"" that come about, in part, due to an overabundance of food (i.e., Type II diabetes, heart disease). While, the natural environment affects regions of food security and insecurity, the policy environment plays an equally strong role in constructing our global food systems. For example, how have changing agricultural policies shaped our food safety problems, such as E. coli contaminated meat or spinach? How have government policies related to labeling of organics shaped the growth of consumer demand for organic agriculture and food products? This class analyzes the socio-economic, political, and cultural construction of our food systems and the ways in which institutions and individuals involved with these systems have experienced dramatic changes in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. We also explore and evaluate the ethical dimensions of agriculture and food policy at the global, regional, and national levels and the ways these policies impact the flow of food around the world (e.g., the World Trade Organization, transnational corporations, NAFTA, the European Union, and national governments). By the end of this course, students will be able to describe the institutions and organizations that are involved in the provision of food at national and international levels, identify problems with the dominant agriculture and food system, and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of many of the proposed solutions for creating a more sustainable and equitable food system.","3 Credits"

This course is an overview of the research (both theoretical and empirical) on institutions as the fundamental driver for economic development, with a particular emphasis on institutional change and institutional/policy reforms. The purpose of the course is to develop an understanding of the institutional foundations of an economy while critically assessing the conventional discourse in the discipline.  Throughout the course, we approach institutional change from a historical perspective. Our focus is on institutional challenges faced by developing nations. In light of the recent institutional turmoil in Western countries, we also discuss institutional erosion and the rise of populism in developed nations.","3 Credits"

Emphasis is placed on developing an understanding of the distinction between stationary and nonstationary (constant mean, variance vs. nonconstant mean and variance data) for estimation purposes in time series contexts. Since nonstationarity is very prevalent in social science applications, understanding estimation approaches to nonstationary data is crucial for nonspurious estimation results. The course will place considerable emphasis on the development of maximum likelihood vector error correction mechanism estimation as a solution to nonstationarity. Throughout, problem sets and exercises place emphasis on real world applications and estimation challenges.","3 Credits"

International development has changed considerably post WWII, not only with some of the same organizations still participating in international development, but also with many new actors and organizations. Alongside organizations and actors have been many academic fields that study and influence aspects of international development, including: anthropology, economics, history, political science, sociology, demography, and public health. We will explore major approaches to international development historically and in the present, as well as consider the effectiveness of international development and the ethics of development assistance. The primary goals of this course are for you to: cultivate a base of knowledge about international development, gain familiarity with topics that people in a variety of disciplines study and shape as it relates to international development, and develop an informed and critical perspective as it relates to the practice and ethics of international development.","3 Credits"

This seminar examines the extractive industry-driven changes in Africa's political economy, as well as in the continent's foreign relations. Students will examine the institutional basis under which the expansion of the industry is taking place in Africa. This will involve discussions of the institutional characteristics of Africa, including issues of land tenure and property rights laws, how institutional systems are changing in order to facilitate the industry's expansion, and the repercussions of these changes upon society. The course also interrogates the relevance of international efforts to mitigate some of the adverse impacts of the industry. Among such efforts is the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. Overall this seminar examines the industry's impact on Africa's socioeconomic development and global relations, and concludes with how African countries might deal with the adverse impact of the Oil and Mining industry.","3 Credits"

It focuses especially on international markets for crude oil and natural gas; attention is also devoted to nuclear energy, the international nuclear industry, and nonproliferation challenges.Students will develop a deep appreciation of the role of energy, and especially hydrocarbon-based energy, in contemporary international affairs. They will learn about the historical development and evolution of hydrocarbon-based energy and the international oil and gas industry; about the various types of contractual arrangements for cross-border investment in upstream oil and gas development and what the differences among these types of agreements reflect regarding the shifting balance of power between resource-owning national governments and foreign investors; and about why and how major energy market players shape their interactions on the basis of political and strategic calculations, along with commercial and economic considerations. They will also learn about the economic and political factors affecting the contribution of nuclear energy to the global energy balance; about the major proliferation risks associated with civil nuclear technology; and about the international regime that has been developed to mitigate these risks and the most pressing challenges to this regime.","3 Credits"

It draws on readings and class discussion to help students develop both a sense of the historical evolution of U.S. policy toward the Middle East and an analytic framework for understanding current policy debates. Students will develop a deep appreciation of the impact of U.S. engagement in the Middle East on modern international history and contemporary international affairs. They will learn about the Middle East's place in the United States post-World War II and post-Cold War grand strategy, about America's decades-long quest for strategic primacy in the region, and about competing visions among American elites for the exercise of that primacy. They will examine the key bilateral relationships (with Saudi Arabia, Israel, and -since 1979 - Egypt) that have shaped U.S. foreign policy toward the Middle East. They will also explore America's long struggle with Saddam Hussein's Iraq and evaluate the U.S. project to build a post-Saddam Iraq that would help consolidate America's post-Cold War dominance in the region. Against this backdrop, students will also learn about major indigenous challenges to American hegemony in the Middle East - e.g., the Islamic Republic of Iran, Islamist resistance movements, and rising demand for participatory Islamist governance among regional publics - and assess U.S. approaches to dealing with these challenges. Students will consider alternative perspectives on jihadi extremism and whether America's self-declared ""war on terror"" has been self-defeating. Likewise, they will examine America's response to the Arab Awakening, with a particular focus on U.S. military interventions in Libya and (indirectly) in Syria, and Turkey's evolving role in the region. Finally, they will look at Russia's resurgence in Middle East affairs and at the impact of China's deepening engagement in the Middle East and the prospects for Sino-American competition for influence there.","3 Credits"

It considers how nation-states define international economic order through the creation of legal frameworks and rules-based regimes; how shifts in the international distribution of power impact these frameworks and regimes; and how, in contemporary context, the United States and China approach global economic governance as part of their grand strategies. To ground their engagement, students will appraise philosophical and analytical perspectives on international economic exchange and economic order - mercantilism, liberalism, realism, and institutionalism. They will examine the concept of hegemonic hegemony and debates over whether economic openness requires a hegemon. Against this backdrop, students will investigate the relationship between American primacy and international economic order. They will consider how U.S. primacy and America's strategic aspirations coming out of World War II shaped the postwar economic order with regard to multilateral trade liberalization (the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs) and monetary relations (the Bretton Woods gold exchange standard). They will evaluate challenges to America's vision of postwar economic order posed by Asian developmentalism and ""mercantile realism."" Likewise, they will assess the OPEC revolution, the American/Western response thereto, and the impact of these developments on the international economic order. Students will continue examining the relationship between American primacy and international economic order by reviewing interpretations of economic globalization as a recasting of the original, post-World War II pax Americana. They will look at how reconstituting American primacy through globalization affected multilateral trade liberalization (the World Trade Organization), monetary relations (the post-Bretton Woods dollar standard), and financial liberalization. They will also evaluate competing visions of post-9/11 American primacy - liberalism, neoconservatism, and realism. Students will then turn to the impact of China's rise on international economic order. They will assay the historical backdrop of China's rise, ongoing processes of economic reform and modernization, Chinese grand strategy, and the challenges China's rise poses to international frameworks for trade and investment, finance and monetary relations, and energy. They will also consider the implications of China's rise for Asian regionalism, the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), and the ""global South."" Finally, through case studies on nuclear energy and nonproliferation and on Iran sanctions, students will look at how contestation between alternative views of international order affects global governance in specific arenas. They will also reflect on the ramifications of these cases for the future of international economic order.","3 Credits"

"International Affairs (INTAF)","INTAF 817","Weapons of Mass Destruction and International Security","Although no nuclear weapon has been used in war in 73 years, they are used every day to affect international security decisions. This course will explore how nuclear weapons revolutionized thinking about war and peace among major powers and how they can become a primary focus of international diplomacy. It will examine why WMD programs (perhaps incorrectly) have come to be seen as a potential cause of war in some contexts and as a primary deterrent to war in others. The course will provide students with the technical understanding of the major classes of WMD (nuclear, chemical and biological weapons) and their effects and it will examine the evolution of international security thinking about their role. It will look both at how major powers (the U.S., Russia and China) conceive of the role of WMD and also how other countries and sub-national groups might consider them. The course will look at how nuclear and biological weapons in particular are for the first time in a generation becoming of increasing concern to strategic thinkers. Finally it will look at the means the U.S., other major powers and the broader international community have developed to limit and perhaps someday to eliminate the threat WMD pose to international peace and perhaps to human existence.","3 Credits"

"International Affairs (INTAF)","INTAF 821","Property, Poverty, and Development","This seminar is for those who are interested in property ownership and the role that it plays in economic development. Case studies will be taken from across the developing world, with a particular focus on Latin America and the Caribbean.  Since the time of the philosopher and social reformer, Jeremy Bentham, we have understood that the poor, like others, are more likely to invest in property if they own it. Hernando De Soto has famously argued that non-transparent legal systems, and titling systems in particular, pose severe impediments to the participation of the poor in capitalist economies. Without title, the poor are less likely to invest in their properties and are often unable to access credit. De Soto estimates that for the developing world, the total value of real estate held by the poor (but not formally titled) is more than 20 times foreign direct investment and more than 90 times all foreign aid for the last 3 decades.  The extent of De Soto's influence can hardly be overstated. In the policy world, his work has inspired decades of World Bank-funded titling programs across several continents. In the academic world, his work has inspired soul-searching among economists and development scholars across the methodological spectrum. Some have argued for communal systems of collective land tenure. Others dispute his estimates of property currently owned by the poor and argue that granting legal title has not improved credit access. Some have also argued that titling systems simply replicate current inequalities. Moreover, in societies where women work the land but do not have equal status in society or in law, their land claims are unlikely to be recognized.  Yet others have criticized De Soto's emphasis on titling arguing that land titling by itself is unlikely to make a significant impact on poverty reduction without parallel reforms such as improving access to the formal banking system, financial literacy and streamlining business regulations. Finally, others question whether extensive investments in titling systems represent a prudent investment in the conditions of extreme economic scarcity that characterize many developing countries, suggesting that in such circumstances, a more ""modest"" approach to legal reforms may be more prudent.  In summary, this seminar will focus on De Soto's ideas on the importance of property reform in combatting poverty and the critiques, particularly in the context of Latin America and the Caribbean.","3 Credits"

"International Affairs (INTAF)","INTAF 853","Engineering, Law, and Policy Systems","This course provides a broad exploration of the relationship between engineering, policy, and law. From driverless cars to AI-powered systems, engineering is transforming public and private spaces. As these new technologies leave the lab and operate in new spaces, each new technology represents a system within that larger, higher-order system. The transformation of these spaces and the interaction of these once-separate systems will be shaped by, and in turn will shape, the public policies of local, state, national, and global policymaking systems. This interdisciplinary course has two objectives. First, it considers the classic engineering problem of integrating subsystems into a larger, higher-order system. In this class, the larger system includes not only other physical systems in the operating space, but also social, legal, and political systems. Second, it considers traditional legal and policymaking institutions as constrained optimization problems. This course identifies the legal and political constraints engineering solutions must satisfy in order to come online.","3 Credits"

"Jewish Studies (JST)","JST 524","Remapping the Holocaust","In most university courses, the Holocaust is taught chronologically, beginning with the rise of the Nazi Party and then following the German armies through Europe and into the Soviet Union. The retreat of those same forces beginning in 1943 parallels the concentration and professionalization of the killing process which then begins to break down as the war comes to an end. This narrative is not incorrect, and certainly makes sense for introductory courses. Yet it also mirrors the perpetrators' perspective. A graduate course allows us to explore different perspectives on the war and genocide and how these affect both the periodization and the geography of the Holocaust. In this course we will examine a number of divergent historiographic trends regarding the origins, enactment, end, and aftermath of the Holocaust. These will help students to think more broadly about the place of the Holocaust in world history and how new theories, methods and questions can be applied to other historical events.","3 Credits"

The choice of primary topic in each iteration of the course is made by the instructor. The course features advanced study of Judaism in a range of historical settings, from its beginnings in biblical Israel to the development of Jewish texts, traditions, and communities in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. By adopting a critical approach, this course offers students an opportunity to conduct and examine research on ancient Judaism in a theoretically informed, cross-disciplinary manner. The course brings methods, material, and insights from Jewish studies to bear on ongoing work in many fields, including history, philosophy, political theory, religious studies, and comparative literature. Course topics may be thematic, revolving around specific themes like diaspora, Jewish identity, Jewish experiences of empire, or questions of gender. They may be organized around specific places or periods, for example: the history of Jerusalem, Jews in Hellenistic Egypt, first-century Palestine, Roman-era Alexandria, or late antique Babylon.

"Jewish Studies (JST)","JST 532","Holocaust and Visual Culture","This course studies how art, literature, film, and other media can provide a perspective on one of the most horrific events in human history, the Holocaust: the genocidal murder of more than six million men, women, and children (mostly Jewish) under the Nazi regime during World War II. The course examines the theoretical questions involved in any attempt to capture what appears to be beyond comprehension in terms of moral outrage and the sheer scale, inhumanity, and bureaucratic efficiency of the violence perpetrated by the Nazis. This course examines formal approaches of depicting the Holocaust in literature and film, as well as photography, museum installations, and memorials. Topics to be discussed include include memorialization (Holocaust museums and memorials), mass murder of the disabled, national guilt, survivor's guilt, stigmatization, and the ethics of historical representation. The course will analyze cinematic strategies for representing the unrepresentable, dark humor about the Holocaust, the persistence of the past, Nazi propaganda, Holocaust photography, trauma theories, graphic novels, the Nuremberg trials, survivor memoirs, representations of the Nuremberg Code and the International Bill of Norms, and possibilities for art after Auschwitz.","3 Credits"
"Jewish Studies (JST)","JST 535","Studies in Jewish American Literature","This course offers students a working analytical familiarity with the history of Jewish writing in the United States (in North American context) and with both the history and the current state of professional study of it. Attention will be paid both to dominant and alternative narratives of this literature. Major historical topics include the earliest, pre-19th century Jewish writers in America; 19th century Jewish American writers; writers of the great Ashkenazi immigration wave of 1881-1924; interwar proletarian and modernist writers; postwar writers of assimilation; the mainstreaming of Jewish American literature in the 1950s and 1960s; post-""breakthrough"" Jewish American writers; and 21st-century Jewish American literature and the new immigration. The course analyzes the development of the professional field of Jewish American literary study, including its prehistory and origins in Wissenschaft-based historicism; the professionalization of the field in the Viet Nam era; the growing dominance of so-called New Jewish Cultural Studies of the `80s and `90s; and new theoretical approaches of the first decades of the 21st century. Finally, the course examines the key debates and faultlines in the field today, including the divide between historicist and critical approaches; differences between English Department-based and Jewish Studies-based Jewish American literary study; the situation of Jewish American literary study vis-à-vis Americanist literary study and English Department-based literary study more generally; Cultural Studies-based approaches to the field vs. Literary Studies-based approaches; Comparativist approaches vs. non-Comparativist approaches; the move toward interdisciplinarity; and the ongoing struggle to theorize the field.","3 Credits"

"Labor and Global Workers' Rights (LGWR)","LGWR 510","International Labor Law","Seminar exploring international labor law, including its standards, reviewing bodies, procedures, information sources, remedies, and overall strenghts and weaknesses.LGWR 510International Labor Law (3) Because globalized production systems call for globalized rules for workplace rights, a body of international labor law is rapidly developing. Designed principally for global labor activists, this course equips students to evaluate the role that international labor law -- its sources, participants, mechanisms, and remedies - plays in the promotion of labor rights in the global economy. A centerpiece of the course looks at the International Labor Organization, whose complex processes introduce students to the generally ""soft"" rules of international workplace regulation. Beyond the ILO, the course looks at other bodies - some global, others regional or bilateral - that require or encourage compliance with decent working standards. It also addresses how private parties can create either voluntary ""codes of conduct"" or negotiated framework agreements spelling out labor rights. Across all of these topics, students take up cases covering the broad range of labor struggles (affecting unions, children, women, immigrants, forced laborers, etc.). Critical to the course is the student's gaining familiarity with the surprising variety of information available on working conditions around the globe. As the course progresses, students are asked to formulate opinions on which international labor law forum holds the greatest potential to help with selected worker rights issues in selected countries. Students will review evidence suggesting that labor activists make their best use of international labor law when they link legal action to outreach, education, research, and ""on the ground"" organizing to enhance chances for success.","3 Credits"
"Labor and Global Workers' Rights (LGWR)","LGWR 520","Global Workers' Rights","This course analyzes struggles to promote workers' rights across a variety of economic, political, and geographic contexts. The stakes of such efforts are high at a time when worker movements face a barrage of new and old challenges. Political attacks, privatization, capital mobility, and automation have contributed to a decades-long decline in union membership in many of labor's traditional strongholds. Meanwhile, the vast majority of the world's workers-particularly women, immigrants, and informal workers-remain unorganized. In this course we will ask, what is the relationship between transformations in global political and economic processes, local labor control regimes and working conditions, and forms of worker resistance? What is the role of such movements in increasing the power of women, people of color, LGTBQ people, and immigrants? What catalyzes worker organizations to expand their focus from members' narrow economic interests to broader struggles for social justice, human rights, and democracy? The first unit of this course analyzes classical and contemporary theories of capitalist development, workplace control, and worker resistance. We will develop a sociological approach that understands workers not as free agents, but as actors embedded in economic, political, and cultural structures. In the second unit, we will analyze the history of the U.S. labor movement, paying careful attention to the way that work has been structured by class strata, gender, race, and region, and the implications for workers' self-organization. The third unit focuses on case studies of worker movements in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Cross-national comparisons will provide leverage for analyzing the complex interaction between movement contexts, ideologies, strategies, and outcomes. We will study how worker movements are shaped and constrained by the states within which they are embedded, but also, how they can sometimes transform the state--for example, by pushing for democratic transitions and workers' rights policies. The fourth unit addresses pressing challenges facing the contemporary global labor movement and potential pathways forward. We will analyze innovative strategies for organizing informal workers, building global labor solidarity, and forging alliances between the labor and climate justice movement.","3 Credits"
"Labor and Global Workers' Rights (LGWR)","LGWR 530","Chinese Labor Rel","Since it opened its economy to private investment in 1978, China's planned economy has been turned into a market-driven economy. Relying heavily on export-oriented industries, China serves as a 'spatial fix' for Western capital, which eagerly searches for new sites of investment and business opportunities. As a result, China has become a gigantic manufacturing hub and the second largest economy in the world. The massive inflow of foreign investment, the pro-business developmental strategies of the Chinese state, and weak legal enforcement of workers' rights have rendered workers victims of economic reform. This course will examine labor relations in post-socialist China. It will cover topics such as the development of China's economic reform, the employment and working conditions of workers, trade unions and the collective bargaining system, the state's role in employment relations, the labor law system, and the role of civil society and non-governmental organizations in the country's labor relations. In addition to China, this course will focus on Vietnam (another post-communist country in Asia), and Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea (three of the four Asian Tigers). It will investigate how these countries are similar to or different from China in terms of socio-economic development and labor relations. Moreover, the course examines labor relations in China and other countries by drawing upon analytical and theoretical concepts on subjects such as the state, the legal system, the economic system, class relations, and civil society.","3 Credits"

"Labor and Global Workers' Rights (LGWR)","LGWR 550","Protest in the Fields: Agricultural Workers and Rural Organizing in a Global Context","The agricultural industry accounts for an enormous share of the global political economy, employing 1 billion people and representing 1 in 3 of all workers. Nonetheless, the organization of agricultural workers is often dismissed as too difficult, given the precarity, isolation, citizenship status, and technological displacement of these workers. This course provides a broad exploration of these global and national shifts in food production, tracing the transformations in the agricultural sector and the labor conditions of agricultural workers in the United States and across Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. It considers how agricultural workers have developed new and innovative organizing strategies to demand economic and political rights. Drawing on diverse examples from the United Farm Workers to the global farmers' organization La Via Campesina (the Peasant Way), we will discuss the struggles for rural unions, environmental rights, land access, and food sovereignty. The goal of the course is to provide students with an overview of how the agricultural sector reproduces racial, economic, gender, and national inequities, while also highlighting the potential power that agricultural workers hold to reshape and reconfigure the global economic system. The first half of the course offers an overview of the political and economic history of the agricultural sector, beginning in the eighteenth century and extending to the current day. This part of the course analyzes the shift from small-family farming to industrial agricultural production, as well as particular issues such as women's access to land, the role of international agencies that regulate the agricultural sector, and the rise of organic farming. Building on these insights, students will develop an original thesis and write a paper that explores how these changes in agricultural production unfolded in one particular country The second half of the course analyzes how rural populations have organized for workers' rights within this shifting industry. This section of the course examines a diverse range of rural organizing efforts, from slave revolts to farmer and farmworker movements to transnational attempts to promote food sovereignty.","3 Credits"
"Labor and Global Workers' Rights (LGWR)","LGWR 560","Gender, Race and Labor in Comparative Perspective","This seminar takes a broad approach to gender by placing it into conversation with race and ethnicity, as well as other lines of difference and inequality, including class, nation, and age, thinking through the dynamic relationship between gender, race and labor from a variety of situated and comparative perspectives. The course begins with two orienting, interwoven perspectives: first, feminist efforts to bring women's experiences, in all their diversity, from the margins to the center of knowledge; and second, the use of gender as a category of analysis-in this way, we will understand gender as relational, in order to study and learn from the lives and experiences of men and trans people, as well as women. Lectures, discussions, and readings in this seminar will draw upon ideas from a range of academic disciplines, addressing questions around intersectionality theory, masculinities, the global division of reproductive labor, and gendered labor and the state all within the context of a transnational and always globalizing world, but with a focus on gender and race-taken together-as an intersectional, critical lens of analysis for understanding multiple relations of power in which we are all embedded, and which shape our experiences. Though gender is an aspect of all social life, this course pays particular attention to gendered and racialized dynamics in the workplace, in the labor process, and in everyday working lives. This course will examine changes in occupational segregation on the basis of race, gender, and immigration status, with a focus on low-wage workers and the growing informal sector. It will also investigate those workers' particular sets of challenges for recognition by the state, unions, and worker centers. And through a comparative, critical perspective, this course focuses the study of gender, race and labor across global and transnational spaces.","3 Credits"

The internship will build and reinforce the students' skills by enabling them to apply what they have learned in the classroom to a real-world labor and global workers' rights setting. As the MPS in LGWR is a professional degree, an internship in a real-world labor and global workers' rights setting is critical to students' academic and professional success. Students complete their internships with US or international labor unions or a labor-oriented organization such as a worker center, labor NGO, or labor research institute. Through the internship, students will learn about priorities, policies and practices that these organizations have regarding workers' rights and/or international labor issues. Students may also gain insight, for example, into the challenges that American unions have with building working relationships and alliances with unions in other countries while also addressing global dynamics affecting working conditions and workers' rights. Prior to the beginning of the internship, students will work with their internship adviser to develop individualized learning objectives. These learning objectives will shape a student's experience at the internship site and the types of projects the student will complete. The learning objectives will also provide the students with a metric by which they can evaluate their effort and performance.","1-6 Credits"

Students begin exploring ways to understand and address issues of regional context. Projects include an emphasis on regional analysis, site and program analysis, and site design in the regional context. Studio work involves research and report writing and medium- to large-scale projects where site design and program are directly influenced by regional factors. Topography, geomorphology, land use, transportation, regional ecology, demographics, landscape history, visual analysis, etc., are covered, all bound into current technological formats using such tools as Geographic Information Systems. Students explore ideas about landscape-scale conservation, linkages, and recreational programming - important types of regional-scale work with which landscape architects are involved. They apply knowledge of the landscape in considering public planning, design, and management interventions, including exploration of alternatives for landscape conservation and recreation. Students become involved, through community outreach projects, with interactive and real (e.g. sometimes messy) public dialogue that may help build community-wide enthusiasm for a landscape project of regional significance.

"Landscape Architecture (LARCH)","LARCH 835","Grad Implementation I: Grading","Computer Applications for Site Analysis and Design. Geometrics: In order to perform landform manipulation, students must be able to efficiently acquire and process physical information about a site and are required to understand a suite of measurements. This course will first provide an overview of the digital and paper data sources available to landscape architects. Students will develop skills in manipulating or processing these data in order to comply with the requirements of site design. The course will also provide the measurements and formulae required for students to efficiently and accurately manipulate landforms. Landform Manipulation: One of the most critical skills landscape architects must acquire as designers is the ability to design landforms to accommodate changes in use and to translate their design ideas into dimensionally precise topographic representations of their designs. This course provides the knowledge for students to complete this process. Beginning with a single site element, students are expected to explore the suite of opportunities to place and modify a site to fit a single site element. Increased complexity is added to the suite throughout the remaining portions of the semester, thus enabling students to balance the opportunities and constraints presented by each individual design element and the overall site design.Site Systems: Building on ecological components of the curriculum, this course provides the first site specific and physical understanding of site systems critical to every landscape architect's design. Students will primarily focus on the major site features as related to site drainage, such as soil, topography, and surface geology, but will also be expected to recognize regional context in their designs. Computer Applications for Site Analysis and Design: A central component underlying the instruction of the course is providing students with a suite of computer tools. Course objectives: a) To assist in initial efforts in acquiring and processing site data; b) To perform calculations such as cut and fill, spot elevations, and slope calculations; c) To visualize and complete manipulation of landforms; d) To understand the interaction of physical site features on individual sites (e.g., soil and topography); and e) To communicate their final site designs according to professional standards","3 Credits"
"Landscape Architecture (LARCH)","LARCH 836","Grad Implementation II: Materials","The landscape architect calls upon a rich array of materials to construct the built elements of landscape walls, ground surfaces, overhead structures, and furniture systems. The functional success and durability of many historical and traditional construction methods is based on a learned appreciation of the qualities and behaviors of materials in use in the landscape. Students develop understanding of the fundamental structural qualities of materials and use that knowledge to devise and illustrate their own design details. The same understanding of material behaviors will be used to investigate the qualities of novel construction materials, and will guide the development of construction details that respond to new constraints and opportunities. The main focus ofLARCH 836will be on materials and construction detailing, with emphasis on techniques appropriate for an array of design situations.

"Law, Policy, and Engineering (LPE)","LPE 853","Engineering, Law, and Policy Systems","This course provides a broad exploration of the relationship between engineering, policy, and law. From driverless cars to AI-powered systems, engineering is transforming public and private spaces. As these new technologies leave the lab and operate in new spaces, each new technology represents a system within that larger, higher-order system. The transformation of these spaces and the interaction of these once-separate systems will be shaped by, and in turn will shape, the public policies of local, state, national, and global policymaking systems. This interdisciplinary course has two objectives. First, it considers the classic engineering problem of integrating subsystems into a larger, higher-order system. In this class, the larger system includes not only other physical systems in the operating space, but also social, legal, and political systems. Second, it considers traditional legal and policymaking institutions as constrained optimization problems. This course identifies the legal and political constraints engineering solutions must satisfy in order to come online.","3 Credits"
"Law, Policy, and Engineering (LPE)","LPE 854","Engineering, Law, and Technology Policy Practicum","In this class, we bridge technology theory with technology policy practice. We begin the semester by asking the ""big"" normative questions of innovation: what kinds of technology are we building? What engineering and ethical principles are we applying? Is this ""progress""? How is law helping (or not helping)? Next, using case studies of ""hot topics"" in technology policy, we apply these ideas to current debates. Finally, through the development of an interdisciplinary team project, the lessons from the first two parts of the class are applied, and as the culminating experience of the Master of Engineering program in Engineering, Law and Policy (MELP), engineering students will apply and integrate their knowledge on strategic science and technology policy, regulatory concepts, and systems thinking to the real world policy issue chosen for the team project. The projects are tailored to meet the current research needs of particular federal and state lawmakers and agencies based on their legislative and regulatory agendas for the year. .Students will analyze technology and policy options and conceive, design, and execute a technology and policy research project, taking into consideration the political, social, and institutional context of technological systems. The deliverables of the course will be a formal oral presentation of the team project, a public-facing technology tool, and a policy research paper written for relevant policymakers, seeking to assist them in their policy decision-making process. This will require students to reconcile the engineering and technical realities and constraints of the projects as well as the legal implications, stepping into the shoes of a policymaker. Possible policy coverage and project areas include connected health; consumer/ investor protection in security and privacy; disinformation, governance, and tech literacy; internet availability and net neutrality; sustainability and ethics in computing design; the Internet of Things and the right to repair; machine learning/ AI suitability; tech competition; computing history; and tech workforce development.","3 Credits"

Participants in this course learn to use the internal features of a CMS and to find and incorporate external tools (i.e., go outside the CMS, create something, bring it back inside). By controlling access and records, course management systems (CMS) provide a safe haven for online learning that protects the learners, the teachers, and the institution. But as closed systems, the CMS limits learning approaches to what is available within the CMS. This course requires directed hands-on experience with a CMS to develop understanding with the capability and limitations of management systems. Students who successfully complete this course will have an expanded repertoire for designing, developing, and implementing learning online and a skill set for integrating new tools and approaches into their instruction. This course provides professionals in corporate and non-profit and other settings with hands-on experiences with online management systems to gain command of, and extend its use. Topical areas that you will read, discuss, and write about include the affordances and constraints of Course Management Systems, the tension between safety online versus access to open resources, mandates (i.e., FERPA and accessibility issues), the current and future forms of virtual classrooms, instructional design models for e-learning, the role of lesson plans as learning objects, evidenced-based didactic and constructivist delivery strategies including project-oriented approaches, problem-based learning, and case-based learning, and e-learning assessment. Subsidiary topics covered include games, simulations, mobile learning, and other breaking current topics related to online course design and delivery. The role and significance of social learning approaches in online courses are emphasized as an essential dynamic in current online courses (e.g., asynchronous discussions, learning communities, and community of inquiry). You will be asked to prepare and then moderate a class discussion and also to participate in an external professional learning community. A central outcome of this course is to actually design effective learning in a CMS. The final course project consists of a learning module that you develop within a course management system of your choice on a topic of your choice for an audience of your choice, and includes serving as instructor or facilitator of that module. You will also review lessons developed by others to provide formative feedback on those modules.","3 Credits"

LING (PSY) 520 Seminar in Psycholinguistics (3 per semester/maximum of 9) In this seminar, psycholinguistic approaches to bilingualism will be examined. Bilingualism is of interest for a number of reasons. First, despite the prevalence of monolinguals in the United States, most people of the world are bilingual. To have a genuinely universal account of human cognition will therefore require a detailed understanding of the relations between language and thought in individuals who speak and understand more than one language. It will be essential that research on basic cognitive functions in bilinguals examines both the course and the consequence of second language acquisition. Second, bilingualism provides a unique vantage point from which the relations between thought and language may be viewed. Historically, this issue was the focus of the debate over the Whorfian hypothesis (i.e., does language determine thought?). In contemporary psychology, it has emerged as a central issue in the debate over modularity. Understanding the form of language and memory representation in the bilingual may provide an important set of constraints in modeling the fundamental categories of the mind. Finally, bilingualism can provide a research tool for examining cognitive functions that are sometimes impenetrable within an individuals first language. The examination of the mapping of form to meaning in Constructing syntactically well-formed sentences in two languages with contrasting syntax, or in understanding the meaning of words that have similar form but differ in meaning in two languages, provides a tool for developing converging sources of evidence to test theories of language comprehension and memory. Topics to be covered include second language acquisition in children and adults, language comprehension and memory in second language, code switching and language mixing, the consequences of bilingualism, and the neuropsychology of bilingualism.","3-9 Credits/Maximum of 9"

This course focuses on increasing knowledge, skill, and confidence to address diversity related challenges that are an inevitable part of the manager's life. Course materials are organized around an Awareness-Empathy-Action/Allyship (AEA) framework. First, students will gain awareness around topics such as bias, prejudice, (in)equity and discrimination in the workplace. Course materials will direct students towards a greater awareness about how their personal biases and values shape decision making in interpersonal and group contexts as well as recognizing sources of bias and discrimination in the context surrounding them. Second, students will learn concepts that allow them to build empathy and take the perspective of others who are different. Often, people can empathize with others who are share a similar background or set of values, but transferring this empathy across differences can be challenging. Through case discussions and experiential learning students will have an opportunity to build their empathy across differences. Both awareness and empathy contribute to the third key component of this course- taking action to ensure equity and inclusion in the workplace. Through cases and exercises students will learn when and how to take individual action as well as promote inclusive and equitable practices in organizations. Overall, the AEA framework provides a pragmatic and evidencebased approach to recognizing and addressing bias and discrimination as well as fostering an inclusive workplace culture.","1-3 Credits"

"Management - BC (MANGT)","MANGT 855","Project Management and Marketing Linkages: New Product and Service Development Process","This is a graduate-level project management elective designed to expose project managers to strategic issues in marketing, opportunity recognition, and new product/service development. Marketing is presented as more than a business function; rather, as a philosophy of doing business. Students will be exposed to marketing management concepts and techniques in both domestic and international markets. This elective is intended to offer a specific context within which a large number of projects are initiated - i.e., new product and service development (NPSD) while broadening the perspective of students to understand how NPSD and project management directly link to marketing. An overview of the field of marketing is presented - from defining marketing and understanding its role in running a successful business to a thorough examination of the marketing mix, holistic marketing, marketing strategies, market opportunities analysis, branding, brand equity, and so on. It presents the marketer's view of product and service development as well as an understanding of stakeholder management and how project managers must work with marketing as a key stakeholder in the NPSD process. Further, the course explores linkages between marketing and project management - e.g., identifying opportunities, developing strategies, building a business case, identifying key performance indicators, and so forth. Identifying opportunities, developing strategies, and designing processes for the creation of new products, are key responsibilities for both entrepreneurs and managers in established firms.

The mechanisms of these solid-state phase transformations involve a wide range of fundamental materials science concepts, including crystallography, nucleation, grain growth, and diffusion. Practitioners must have knowledge across a range of materials disciplines, including thermodynamics, kinetics, and crystallography, in order to synthesize and capture the complex processes occurring over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Knowledge of these fundamental concepts along with their interactions over a range of length scales is applicable across a range of conventional and emerging materials processing fields, from primary steelmaking through heat treatment of nickel and aluminum-base alloys through the additive manufacturing of a wide range of advanced materials. In this course, a comprehensive study of solid state phase transformations in metallic materials will be undertaken.

MATSE (PHYS) 555 Polymer Physics I (3) This course develops fundamental understanding of the conformations of polymers in solution and melt states. We start with ideal chains that have random walk statistics. Next excluded volume is introduced to understand the self-avoiding walk conformation and collapsed conformation of real chains. The behavior ideal and real chains are studied in extension, compression and adsorption. While positive excluded volume leads to swelling, negative excluded volume leads to collapse and phase separation. The phase behavior of polymer mixtures and solutions is described in detail Semidilute solutions are understood in terms of two length scales where each chain changes it's conformational statistics. Scattering is used to determine the conformation of chains, their molar mass and their interactions with surroundings. Percolation theory is introduced to model the statistics of random branching and gelation. The rubber elasticity of fully developed networks is understood in terms of the stretching laws for network chains. Entanglement effects, swelling and viscoelasticity are discussed in detail. Once the conformations of polymers are understood, dynamics of polymer liquids are considered. In dilute solutions hydrodynamic interactions dominate and the viscoelasticity predicted by the Zimm model is derived. In unentangled melts of short chains, hydrodynamic interactions are screened and the Rouse model is used to understand viscoelasticity. Unentangled polymers in semidilute solutions have Zimm dynamics on small length scales and Rouse dynamics on longer length scales. Dynamic scattering techniques are discussed for measuring polymer dynamics. Entanglement effects are described using the tube model, where surrounding chains confine the motion of a given polymer to a tube-like region. The effects of concentration, chain length and polydispersity of linear chain polymer liquids are discussed in detail. The effects of branching on polymer dynamics are introduced at the level of simple structures such as star polymers and comb polymers. The course assumes some prior knowledge of polymers, usually obtained through an introductory undergraduate course.

This spectrum includes synoptic scale storms whose structure and dynamics vary with latitude and topography as well as a broad range of mesoscale phenomena whose structure depends strongly on the vertical structure of the atmosphere. At these intermediate scales, each phenomenon draws energy from conditions created by phenomena of both larger and smaller scale phenomena. Thus, the full spectrum of weather phenomena is linked energetically. This course explores these linkages and the dynamics of the weather phenomena that result. Quantitative results from this theoretical analysis are then used to explain the structure and behavior of the phenomena themselves. Using both theoretical and observational methods students will gain an understanding of the full spectrum of weather phenomena including the physics and dynamics responsible for their structure, development, and evolution.","3 Credits"

"Meteorology (METEO)","METEO 528","Parameterization Schemes","Parameterization is the process by which important physical processes that cannot be resolved explicitly in a numerical model are represented. Examples include the transfer of shortwave radiation through the atmosphere, and the formation of cloud droplets, both of which occur on the molecular scale. As numerical models have grid spacing of hundreds of meters, molecular processes are not resolved explicitly in current models and so must be parameterized. A parameterization scheme is a representation of our understanding of the physical process as related to the available model variables, such that one can estimate how the behaviors of these important sub-grid physical processes influence the available model variables. In this way, sub-grid scale physical processes are included in models even when they cannot be explicitly represented. The most common parameterization schemes used in numerical models of the atmosphere will be discussed, including land and ocean surface, planetary boundary layer, convection, microphysics, radiation, cloud cover, and orographic drag. Emphasis is placed upon understanding the basic approaches to parameterization and how the differences in approaches influence the resulting behaviors.","3 Credits"

"Meteorology (METEO)","METEO 556","The Atmospheric Boundary Layer","The atmospheric boundary layer is the layer of the atmosphere that is in frequent contact with the surface of the earth. It is the layer where life exists, and which mediates exchanges of energy, momentum, and chemicals between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. The scales of motion in the atmospheric boundary layer, because of the presence of the earth's surface, are small compared to the rest of the atmosphere. The dynamics, therefore, differ from those found in the 'free' atmosphere. This course describes the physical properties of the layer of the earth's atmosphere that is in frequent contact with the earth's surface, the atmospheric boundary layer. The course includes a descriptive overview of this layer using observations, then presents the governing equations and common simplifications used to describe the boundary layer. Conservation of mass, energy, and momentum, are covered. A core principle is the decomposition of the governing equations into a mean state and turbulent components, and the challenges introduced by this decomposition. The concepts of eddy diffusivity and closure methods are motivated by this challenge. These principles and governing equations are used to understand the typical evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer as a function of time of day. Convective and stable boundary layer conditions are contrasted. The contrasting conditions are linked to changes in the exchange of energy, momentum and water vapor at the earth's surface. The fundamentals of plume dispersion are described and tested. A simple numerical model of the atmospheric boundary layer is discussed and applied to atmospheric data. Stability conditions in the atmosphere are further explored using the equation for turbulent kinetic energy. Parameters describing the turbulence state of the surface layer and boundary layer, including the Obukhov length, friction velocity, convective velocity scale, and Richardson number, are discussed and applied to typical boundary layer conditions and observations. Similarity theory is discussed as a means of describing turbulent properties of the atmospheric boundary layer as a function of stability conditions. Monin-Obukhov similarity theory for the surface layer is applied to atmospheric observations. Additional common atmospheric boundary layer states are described, including cloud topped boundary layers, marine boundary layers, and boundary layers in heterogeneous terrain. Observational, measurement and numerical methods are presented and used in class assignments.","3 Credits"

Students who successfully completeMETEO 801will be able to apply knowledge of fundamental concepts of atmospheric science to discriminate between reliable and unreliable weather forecasts, to explain what makes one forecast better than another, and to teach these same concepts and applications to secondary school students. To ensure that students develop the knowledge and skills required to critically assess public weather forecasts,METEO 801will provide an apprentice-training environment that will encourage students to learn forecast mid-latitude weather themselves. They will discover that weather forecasting involves sophisticated data analysis techniques, a thorough understanding of atmospheric science, and strong verbal and graphic communication skills.METEO 801will combine digital video, audio, simulation models, virtual field trips to on-line weather data resources, text, and interactive quizzes that provide instantaneous feedback.

"Meteorology (METEO)","METEO 802","Fundamentals of Tropical Forecasting for Educators","Applying atmospheric principles to the tropics, with an emphasis on the development, structure, prediction, and destructive impact of hurricanes.METEO 802Fundamentals of Tropical Forecasting for Educators (3) Worldwide, approximately 80 tropical cyclones develop each year. This global annual average of tropical cyclones is small in comparison to the thousands of low-pressure systems that routinely parade across the middle latitudes each year. Yet tropical storms and hurricanes garner far greater attention from meteorologists and the media. The obvious reason for this lopsided focus is that tropical cyclones can inflict great devastation to life and property. To ensure that students develop the knowledge and skills required to critically assess weather forecasts issues by the National Hurricane Center,METEO 802provides, likeMETEO 801, an apprentice-training environment. Under the tutelage of professional weather forecasters, students, in their role as apprentices, work toward the goal of creating their own tropical-weather forecasts. In the process, students inMETEO 802learn about the pitfalls of forecasting the tracks and intensities of tropical storms and hurricanes as they actively work with output from sophisticated numerical models available on the Internet. Moreover, successful students apply their knowledge of the fundamental concepts of atmospheric science in order to competently evaluate forecasts issues by the National Hurricane Center in Miami and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Honolulu. Students also gain a broad perspective of the general weather and oceanic patterns in the tropics. For example, students learn about El Nino and La Nina. In the process, they discover the El Nino and La Nina are not to blame for every unusual weather even that occurs anywhere in the world. To facilitate the learning objectives,METEO 802includes the use of digital video, audio, simulation models, virtual field trips to on-line resources for weather data, text, and interactive quizzes that provide timely feedback.

"Meteorology (METEO)","METEO 803","Fundamentals of Mesoscale Weather Forecasting for Educators","Applying atmospheric principles to small-scale weather systems, with an emphasis on the conceptual modeling and short-range prediction of severe thunderstorms.METEO 803Fundamentals of Mesoscale Weather Forecasting for Educators (3) When outbreaks of severe weather occur, dire warnings for tornadoes, large hail or damaging straight-line winds urgently scroll across the bottoms of television screens. Simultaneously, television weathercaster's warn viewers to ""take cover immediately."" Yet, because of the limited spatial and time scales of severe thunderstorms, the areas affected by tornadoes, large hail and damaging straight-line winds often turns out to be relatively small (sometimes as small as a tenth of one percent of the original ""watch area""). There is no doubt that people should be prepared to take definitive action to protect their lives and the lives of their families when outbreaks of severe weather occur. But the overall impression that entire counties or cities will be destroyed by severe weather can be, and frequently is, misleading. To ensure that students develop the knowledge and skills required to critically assess public weather forecasts,METEO 803provides an apprentice training environment that guides students, under the tutelage of professional weather forecasters, to actively learn how to create their own mesoscale-weather forecasts. In the process,METEO 803reinforces the notion that weather forecasting involves sophisticated techniques of data analysis and a thorough understanding of atmospheric science.METEO 803also stresses that the clear communication of the forecast requires strong verbal and graphic communication skills. Using conceptual models and real-time radar and satellite imagery in concert with output from numerical models designed specifically for mesoscale forecasting, students predict severe weather on time scales of a few hours to one day. For example, students are required to choose a tornado ""watch-box"" issued by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) in Norman, Oklahoma, and then to evaluate the forecast (and forecast verification) in the setting of a litany of scientifically sophisticated tools on SPC's Web site. In effect, students will mirror the process that professional forecasters follow to create such high-profile forecasts. For more general outlooks that identify regions where there is a potential for severe weather (time scales of one to two days), students will use output from the numerical models that were introduced inMETEO 801to identify the areas likely to be at risk for severe weather. To facilitate the learning objectives,METEO 803includes the use of digital video, audio, simulation models, virtual field trips to on-line resources for weather data, text, and interactive quizzes that provide timely feedback. The course will provide unprecedented access to one of the world's most distinguished meteorology programs.METEO 803students will be granted licenses to use the courseware developed for this course in their own secondary classrooms. One of the primary goals ofMETEO 803is to give secondary science teachers a scientifically grounded perspective of the spatial and time scales of typical outbreaks of severe weather and other events associated with mesoscale weather systems. In the process, students become better weather consumers and to be able to effectively convey their knowledge to their students as part of an Earth science curriculum. To gain such insights, students learn conceptual models of the life cycles of severe thunderstorms and then apply them in real-time outbreaks of severe weather. In the final analysis, students are able to more accurately weigh the information being disseminated by the media and the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Students will be required to complete weekly assignments. There are 8 lessons inMETEO 803. Each lesson contains interactive exercises, links, animations, movies, and novel explanations of the basic scientific principles of how the atmosphere works. To demonstrate their mastery of the learning objectives, students complete automated online quizzes, actively engage in online discussion groups focusing on real-time weather, and publish, to a personal ""e-portfolio,"" three comprehensive projects that explore timely case studies related to mesoscale weather forecasting. The e-portfolio takes the form of a Web site. In addition to posting their work to their e-portfolio, students also use the space to reflect on their learning. By using their Penn State personal Web space to host their e-portfolios, students are able to share their work not only with program faculty and students, but also with external audiences, including potential employers.","3 Credits"

An application of these ideas might look like software in which one can search all of Beethoven's works to determine exactly how often he followed a V7 chord with a vi chord; this would be called Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Using a computer to calculate the possible solutions to a species counterpoint exercise might be computer-assisted music theory. The course will have a seminar-like format in which current research is reviewed and students undertake projects in MIR or CAM.","3 Credits"

"Nanotechnology (NANO)","NANO 521","Pattern Transfer at the Nano-scale","Engineering at the nano-scale often requires creating and then transferring a pattern when fabricating a desired nano-scale structure. This course explores the basic processes of pattern design and then addresses the techniques used to transfer a nano-scale pattern to a surface or structure. The course looks into pattern transfer techniques that employ particles, photons, and additional chemical and physical means as the transfer mechanisms. Included in the photon approaches are studies of deep UV and X-ray pattern transfer. Particle transfer mechanisms discussed include ion and neutral particle approaches. Physical-contact pattern transfer is also explored including discussions of nano-imprinting lithography, nano-molding lithography, and scanning probe lithography. Chemical pattern transfer is another approach to pattern transfer and one that uniquely uses chemical processes to create patterns. Examples to be discussed in this course include molecular self-assembly lithography and block co-polymer lithography. Emerging pattern transfer techniques, such as magneto-lithography, will be included in E SC 521 for completeness. In many of these pattern transfer methodologies, a ""writing"" of the transferring pattern into some intermediary medium termed a resist is required. In pattern technologies requiring resists, the resist materials and their positioning as well as required physical and chemical properties will be discussed.","3 Credits"
"Nanotechnology (NANO)","NANO 523","Fabrication and Characterization for Bottom-up Nano-manufacturing","There are two broad approaches to fabrication and manufacturing at the nano-scale: bottom-up and top-down nanofabrication. These are complementary with the former having strong ties to biology and the latter having strong ties to traditional semiconductor processing. E SC 523 focuses on the bottom-up approaches, which provide an increasingly important alternative to top-down techniques. Bottom-up approaches to nano-scale fabrication mimic nature in harnessing fundamental chemical or physical forces operating at the nano-scale to assemble basic units into larger structures. The bottom-up, or self-assembly, techniques explored in this course cover material synthesis, structure fabrication, and material and structure characterization. The production of 0-D, 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D materials will be discussed and then the assembly of these materials into structures will be explored. Fabrication topics to be covered will include block co-polymer manipulation, vapor-liquid-solid growth, the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, surface functionalization, molecular self-assembly, DNA Origami, and bacterial and viral assembly. The characterization techniques to be covered will include those emerging tools capable of ultra-precise resolution such as tip-enhanced Raman scanning microscopy, scanning helium ion microscopy, and magnetic resonance sub-nanometer imaging.","3 Credits"
"Neuroscience - MD (NEURO)","NEURO 501","Neuroscience Seminar","This is a weekly seminar involving discussion of research approaches and methodologies used by guest speakers for the neuroscience seminar series.NEURO 501Neuroscience Seminar (2 per semester/maximum of 8) This course examines issues related to the research presented by invited speakers in the Neuroscience Seminar series. This is a required course for first and second-year graduate students in the Neuroscience program. The intent is to generate discussion that aids in the understanding of the general research questions, techniques and conclusions reflected in the work of the various speakers. Speakers will address topics ranging from the molecular to human behavior. The Neuroscience Seminar course has two components: (1) the students present on the background research (approaches, methods, and concepts) related to the invited speaker's work. The students will read 2-3 papers from a list of the speaker's publications prior to the seminar. The host of the invited speaker (and sometimes the speaker himself or herself, depending on availability) will join the students in the discussion. Each time there will be one student who leads the discussion. Students will participate in discussions with the invited speaker, the instructor, and with other students who may have different research experiences and backgrounds. (2) the students will attend the seminar delivered by the invited speaker and participate in the discussion and question and answer periods.","2 Credits/Maximum of 8"

"Neuroscience - MD (NEURO)","NEURO 512","Comparative Neuroanatomy","This course elucidates the structural organization of the nervous system and describes the evolutionary principles that guide brain development.NEURO 512Comparative Neuroanatomy (4) This course provides instruction on the functional and structural organization of the vertebrate central nervous system. In addition to lectures, students attend laboratory sessions devoted to human brain dissections, histologic sections of various vertebrate brains, and non-invasive magnetic resonance images.Following instruction on the structural and physiological properties of neurons, students learn how structural and neurochemical variations endow neurons with specific computational properties so that connections between different neuronal subtypes enable local circuits to extract information and create specific input-output transformations that define the functional character of each neural system. The structural organization of the brain is then described both grossly and at the level of functional circuits.Material at the gross level describes the 3-D spatial relationships among the nuclei and fiber tracts within each subdivision of the central nervous system so that students can describe the internal organization of the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord. As part of this, students learn to recognize specific structures in different planes of sections along the major axes of the brain.Material at the functional level describes the sensory, motor, and limbic systems according to their circuit connections. Emphasis is placed on the specific connections that enable circuits to transform specific types of information. Students are expected to describe the successive series of nuclei and interconnected pathways that comprise each major neural system.Students are also taught to view neuroanatomy as a scientific field of inquiry. Landmark discoveries and the methods by which prominent neuroanatomists made those discoveries provide a context for describing brain organization. Breakthrough scientific experiments are discussed to illustrate how the structural-functional relationships of the brain have been elucidated. Attention is also devoted to instructing students in modern experimental methods that are used to determine how brain circuits are altered by experimental manipulations.While the course emphasizes the mammalian nervous system, many aspects of brain organization in non-mammalian vertebrates are presented.

U.S. policy has evolved over a period of more than sixty years since the Manhattan Project and has embraced the importance of both safeguards (applicable to weapons states and non-weapons states that commit to peaceful use of nuclear materials) and proliferation prevention (policies intended to deter and detect attempts to illicitly acquire nuclear weapons). Over this time improvements in technology have increased the potential for proliferation but have also increased the ability to detect proliferation. Recently, heightened danger of unauthorized proliferation by states and, more worrisome, transnational non-states, has led to increased emphasis on control and detection. Within this context students in this course will study U.S. national security strategy in the areas of counterterrorism and nonproliferation. We will discuss those policies aimed at enhancing nuclear security and examine the roles of various agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy (including the National Nuclear Security Administration), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Defense, and the Environmental Protection Agency. International treaties and conventions on nuclear safeguards, arms control, and terrorism will be covered. Regulations promulgated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency will also be studied. The course will consider how these policies are intended to control the actions of both state and non-state adversaries and applications to both government and private sector nuclear activities.

That is, the students will achieve an expert's understanding of the central ideas of one figure in twentieth-century philosophy. On this basis, students will be able to develop a comprehensive understanding of the figure's entire corpus and complete range of ideas. Moreover, students will be able to develop a comprehensive understanding of the historical period. There are many possible figures for this course: Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Simone de Beauvoir, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Julia Kristeva, Alain Badiou, John Dewey, Jurgen Habermas, Rudolf Carnap, Wilfred Sellars, W. V. O. Quine, Hilary Putnam, and Richard Rorty. In relation to Husserl, for example, students will master the problems (relativism and skepticism) to which phenomenology is responding; the phenomenological method (the epoche, the reductions, eidetic variation); and how the transcendental position of phenomenology at once responds to the question of knowledge and to the question of being. This knowledge will allow students to develop an understanding of the phenomenology's crucial role in the development of twentieth-century philosophy, influencing not only existentialism, structuralism, and post-structuralism, but also analytic philosophy. In relation to Merleau-Ponty, for example, students will learn how embodied perception attempts to respond to the traditional problem of mind-body dualism. This knowledge will allow students to develop an understanding not only of Merleau-Ponty's view of language but also his view of politics. From this developed understanding of Merleau-Ponty, students will be able to understand how Merleau-Ponty differs from Bergson, Merleau-Ponty's predecessor, from Sartre, Merleau-Ponty's contemporary, and from Foucault, Merleau-Ponty's inheritor.

The challenge is that we are in an uncharted ethical territory with regard to AI: we need to radically adjust our existing ethical paradigms or introduce new ones as we experience and acquire a better grasp of the problems involved in AI-human interaction. A large portion of these issues reflect our concerns about the harm that the use and misuse of AI might cause for humanity. Such issues range from threats to individual privacy and freedom to wider social implications regarding economic justice and race and gender equality. However, as AI systems develop and attain higher levels of intelligence, questions about their moral status become more pressing. If these systems are capable of moral agency, then not only do they have responsibilities towards other moral agents like us, but they also have rights that we should respect in our conduct towards them. This course offers an overview of the nature and extent of the ethical issues arising from AI-human interaction as well as the philosophical background (particularly, in ethics and philosophy of mind) required to develop an informed methodology in approaching these issues, with the help of the flourishing literature on the subject.","3 Credits"

In particular, they reveal the origin of universality between seemingly unrelated phase transitions, and the reason for the failure of the Landau Ginzburg theory close to the critical point. This course will begin with the concepts of the order parameter and spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the shortcomings of the Landau Ginzburg theory that neglects fluctuations of the order parameter. Subsequently, we will introduce field theoretical techniques and Feynman diagrams, and the basic foundations of the renormalization group method for integrating out rapidly fluctuating modes of the order parameter. These concepts will be applied to various classes of phase transitions, including the Heisenberg ferromagnet, nonlinear sigma model, and the Kosterlitz-Thouless model.

"Physics (PHYS)","PHYS 555","Polymer Physics I","Introduction to the fundamental concepts needed to understand the physics applicable to polymer melts, solutions and gels. MATSE (PHYS) 555 Polymer Physics I (3) This course develops fundamental understanding of the conformations of polymers in solution and melt states. We start with ideal chains that have random walk statistics. Next excluded volume is introduced to understand the self-avoiding walk conformation and collapsed conformation of real chains. The behavior ideal and real chains are studied in extension, compression and adsorption. While positive excluded volume leads to swelling, negative excluded volume leads to collapse and phase separation. The phase behavior of polymer mixtures and solutions is described in detail Semidilute solutions are understood in terms of two length scales where each chain changes it's conformational statistics. Scattering is used to determine the conformation of chains, their molar mass and their interactions with surroundings. Percolation theory is introduced to model the statistics of random branching and gelation. The rubber elasticity of fully developed networks is understood in terms of the stretching laws for network chains. Entanglement effects, swelling and viscoelasticity are discussed in detail. Once the conformations of polymers are understood, dynamics of polymer liquids are considered. In dilute solutions hydrodynamic interactions dominate and the viscoelasticity predicted by the Zimm model is derived. In unentangled melts of short chains, hydrodynamic interactions are screened and the Rouse model is used to understand viscoelasticity. Unentangled polymers in semidilute solutions have Zimm dynamics on small length scales and Rouse dynamics on longer length scales. Dynamic scattering techniques are discussed for measuring polymer dynamics. Entanglement effects are described using the tube model, where surrounding chains confine the motion of a given polymer to a tube-like region. The effects of concentration, chain length and polydispersity of linear chain polymer liquids are discussed in detail. The effects of branching on polymer dynamics are introduced at the level of simple structures such as star polymers and comb polymers. The course assumes some prior knowledge of polymers, usually obtained through an introductory undergraduate course. The students should attain a working understanding of the basic concepts of polymer physics in this course, allowing them to tackle more difficult problems in their research. Such skills are reinforced through homework and take-home examinations.","3 Credits"

"Political Science (PLSC)","PLSC 519","Survey Methods II: Analysis of Survey Data","Intermediate course on the statistical analysis of survey data: topics include weighting, complex surveys, missing data, and contextual analysis.  PL SC (SOC) 519 Survey Methods II: Analysis of Survey Data (3)This is an intermediate level course in quantitative analysis. It is intended for graduate students who have completed 1-2 semesters of graduate-level statistics (not general research methods) and who are interested in the application of social statistics to the unique aspects of data collected by way of surveys. Surveys have a combination of qualities that represent challenges to valid inference. These include cluster and stratified sampling, under-representation of some groups due to differential response rates, missing data due to item non-response, cross-sectional design, and coarse measurement. Quite often we use surveys to test theories that the original survey designer did not intend to address, raising issues of validity and reliability of measurement. At the same time, surveys offer a number of opportunities and, when combined with other surveys (pooled cross sections) or merged with contextual data, can address a wide range of theoretical puzzles in the social sciences. This course provides an introduction to techniques in applied statistics that have developed specifically to address the special features of survey data. Examples of such techniques are: use of design weights, post-stratification weights, merging surveys with other surveys or auxiliary data, missing data imputation, challenges of causal inference. The class will blend an understanding of the core statistical issues with an emphasis on acquiring an intuition for the theory underlying the statistical models rather than focusing on proofs and estimation. This will provide a foundation for frequent hands-on applications in this seminar and for enrollment in more advanced or more in-depth courses offered by the Statistics department and the various social science departments.","3 Credits"

PL SC 543 Political Representation (3) This seminar will investigate significant concepts, ideas, and research questions addressed in recent and classic studies of political representation. It will take up questions and issues central both to an understanding of American politics and to an assessment of the nature and quality of democratic governance: how are citizen interests represented and how responsive is government to citizen preferences? The seminar begins with an investigation of different types of political representation, some of which are policy-related and others of which are not rooted in public policy. It next takes up assessments of the relationship between citizen preferences and public policy (policy responsiveness); biases and inequality in representation; and the role of political intermediaries, namely organized interests and political parties, in facilitating the representation of citizen interests. The implications of a more or less representative political system are then examined. Throughout the seminar, attention is paid to how political scientists formulate and execute research on political representation, as well as to how the design of such research affects what is known about representation. Seminar participants will be required to engage in extensive careful reading, contribute to weekly discussion, prepare short written critical responses to the readings, and complete an original research project that takes up questions relevant to our understanding of representation.","3 Credits/Maximum of 9"

PL SC 552 Comparative Political Behavior (3 per semester/maximum of 9) This course will explore the nature of social movements and revolutions. We will look at the major theories that sociologists and political scientists have created to explain the development and outcomes of social movements and revolutions. How do we explain why people participate in revolutions or social movements? Why is it that some people never revolt although observers would say they are as bad off as others that do? What sorts of factors determine the tactics people will use once they decide something must be done? Can governments repress revolutions or social movements? What determines whether a social movement or revolution is successful? In examining these questions we will read theoretical works, quantitative studies comparing many different social movements or revolutions, and case studies of particular social movements and revolutions. By the end of this course, you should have a good grasp of the theoretical debates about social movements and the methods which have been used to study revolutions and social movements, and you will have cursory knowledge of several different revolutions and social movements ranging from the French Revolution to the American Civil Rights Movement.

"Political Science (PLSC)","PLSC 553","Comparative Racial and Ethnic Politics","Since its founding, the United States has had to balance the American creed of equality for all, on one hand, with racial inequality, on the other hand. Is this challenge something exclusive to the United States? This course will provide students the opportunity to analyze how race and ethnicity are constructed across the globe as well as how race and politics interact across state borders. Students will examine how race is constructed and racial ideologies are developed in several countries including the U.S., South Africa, France, Australia and Brazil. By the end of the semester, students should be able to fully engage and contribute to broad literatures on the politics and policy of race and racism. They should readily be able to answer questions such as: What role do countries and their institutions play in developing racial ideologies and racial hierarchies? What political purpose do ideologies such as ""racial democracy"" serve? How might social scientists best compare notions such as U.S.'s ""race problem,"" Latin America's ""shade problem"" and Europe's ""immigrant problem""? What are the perils of cross-border comparisons, and how, if possible, can social scientists account for state differences in their analyses? The major objectives of the course are to: (1) analyze the effects of historical, social, economic, cultural and global forces on the development of racial and ethnic politics in various countries; (2) define and critically analyze concepts relevant to the study of racial and ethnic politics; (3) identify, critique and apply major academic theories and debates regarding issues of race, ethnicity, inequality and reconciliation; (4) build analytical skills so that students will be able to effectively engage and communicate in public and scholarly discourse about race and ethnic politics; (5) improve writing skills, especially as they relate to manuscript and book reviews; (6) become cognizant of the difficulties that scholars must navigate as they approach topics related to the politics, race, ethnicity as well as comparative/cross-state analysis; and (7) develop a series of best practices to address methodological and theoretical challenges to studying race comparatively.","3 Credits"

LING (PSY) 520 Seminar in Psycholinguistics (3 per semester/maximum of 9) In this seminar, psycholinguistic approaches to bilingualism will be examined. Bilingualism is of interest for a number of reasons. First, despite the prevalence of monolinguals in the United States, most people of the world are bilingual. To have a genuinely universal account of human cognition will therefore require a detailed understanding of the relations between language and thought in individuals who speak and understand more than one language. It will be essential that research on basic cognitive functions in bilinguals examines both the course and the consequence of second language acquisition. Second, bilingualism provides a unique vantage point from which the relations between thought and language may be viewed. Historically, this issue was the focus of the debate over the Whorfian hypothesis (i.e., does language determine thought?). In contemporary psychology, it has emerged as a central issue in the debate over modularity. Understanding the form of language and memory representation in the bilingual may provide an important set of constraints in modeling the fundamental categories of the mind. Finally, bilingualism can provide a research tool for examining cognitive functions that are sometimes impenetrable within an individuals first language. The examination of the mapping of form to meaning in Constructing syntactically well-formed sentences in two languages with contrasting syntax, or in understanding the meaning of words that have similar form but differ in meaning in two languages, provides a tool for developing converging sources of evidence to test theories of language comprehension and memory. Topics to be covered include second language acquisition in children and adults, language comprehension and memory in second language, code switching and language mixing, the consequences of bilingualism, and the neuropsychology of bilingualism.","3-9 Credits/Maximum of 9"

"Psychology (PSY)","PSY 532","Psychological Foundations of Leadership","Students will examine the social and psychological processes underlying leadership in organizations.PSY 532Psychological Foundations of Leadership (3) Emerging organizational challenges underscore the criticality of leadership in successful organizational functioning - a trend that is as true for the corporate world as it is for non-profit and governmental institutions. Underlying the need for well-trained, effective leaders is the requirement that future leaders have a fundamental understanding of the psychological processes driving successful leadership. This course provides a broad exploration of the theoretical bases for understanding leadership. Specifically, in this course, students will have the opportunity to learn about the psychological, cognitive, and social foundations underpinning leadership thinking and theory. In particular, course readings and activities will explore traits associated with leadership, psychodynamic perspectives on leaders, skills and styles used by effective leaders, contingency approaches to leadership, the role of power and influence, leader-member exchanges, team-based leadership, transformational leadership, and servant and authentic leadership. By exploring these topics, students will improve their critical thinking about their roles as leaders and expand their skillset to operate more effectively as future leaders. Students will consolidate and demonstrate their understanding of and ability to apply conceptual bases of understanding leadership to analysis of leadership situations and to improving their own capacity for leadership by participating in a number of course activities. For example, students will learn to apply their learning about course topics such as psychological perspectives on leadership to real-world examples of leadership. Moreover, students will gain a deep understanding of the complexities surrounding effective leadership by reviewing representations of leadership in popular culture and carrying out activities that require reflection on those representations. Such deep understanding will be reinforced through exposure to relevant examples, discussion, and cases that emphasize the application of leadership models and theory to practice. Final writing assignments will serve as a vehicle for students to recognize and identify concepts such as leadership styles and types of leadership and to apply them to developing reflective awareness of the psychological processes that drive successful leadership. The conceptual framework for the course will be the psychological principles guiding the development and instantiation of successful leadership.","3 Credits"

"Psychology (PSY)","PSY 539","Foundations of Behavior, Motivation, and Attitudes at Work","Students will examine the psychological and social processes underlying behavior, motivation, and attitudes in work settings.PSY 539Foundations of Behavior, Motivation, and Attitudes at Work (3) Ongoing changes in the nature of work (e.g., increasingly jobs are knowledge-based), the workforce (e.g., more diverse), and employee-organizational linkages (e.g., greater mobility of employees from organization to organization; increased employee responsibility for maintaining work-relevant skills and knowledge) result in increasing complexity and variability in individual motivation and attitudes at work that, in turn, lead to challenges for leaders in their attempts to influence and develop their employees. Knowledge of the many psychological factors affecting motivation and attitudes, and related skills in understanding the specific ones that may be relevant in a given organizational setting, are critical for effective leadership. This course will provide a broad exploration of research and theory concerning the psychological factors that underlie motivational and attitudinal processes related to human behavior in work and organizational settings. In particular, the course investigates both positive and dysfunctional work behaviors, and their causes and consequences; work attitudes, including job satisfaction and organizational commitment; work motivation theories, including need and trait approaches, behavioral approaches, and cognitive approaches; the role of work content and context and social factors on motivation and attitudes; the importance of aligning such factors to create a work environment supporting effective employees and work groups; and how the changing nature of work and organizations may impact the importance of these factors. The course will focus on the development of the students' ability to think critically about the complexity of factors that influence behavior and the wide range of individual differences in behavior, emotions, and thinking that occur even when individuals experience a common work environment. Building on these insights, students will learn to recognize and identify in specific work settings the situational conditions that may enhance and/or inhibit effective employee motivation, attitudes, and behavior. Students will also develop skill in aligning various organizational programs and policies to maximize the overall positive impact on effective employee behavior. Synthesis of the various theories and sets of research findings will be developed by the use of relevant examples, cases, and discussions that allow students to demonstrate their knowledge in relation to the development of leadership behaviors likely to be effective in various organizational situations.","3 Credits"

Academically and professionally, disaster psychology contributes an important perspective to emergency management within an all-hazards and a whole-of-community approach to homeland security: Based on a general civil security perspective, it addresses the way people perceive and experience disasters, the way they react to them, and the way they recover from them. Within this context, the course explores the psychological impact of disasters and terrorist attacks on victims, families, rescuers, and society and methods of reducing negative psychological effects. Topics covered include the perception and communication of risk, psychological effects of traumatic events, and psychological interventions to reduce harmful psychological effects of disasters.","3 Credits"

"Psychology (PSY)","PSY 811","Global and Cross-Cultural Leadership","Students will examine the relation of cultural variations in psychological and social factors affecting the effective leadership of individuals and groups in work organizations.PSY 811Global and Cross-Cultural Leadership (3) Contemporary organizations have become increasingly focused on both the global marketplace and global competition. Large organizations frequently have physical locations and employees in numerous countries around the globe, but many relatively small organizations compete on a global scale even if physically located in one or a few countries. One consequence of the global marketplace is that organizational leaders need a global mindset in order to be effective in their leadership roles, that is, an awareness of the impact of culture on factors such as work-related values, norms, and expectations such that cultural differences are an automatic part of leader and organization decision-making. This course provides a comprehensive examination of the psychological, social, and cultural factors that underlie expectations, preferences, and judged effectiveness of leadership practices and styles in organizations and work groups in the major cultural regions of the world. The course will focus on the development of the students' ability to think critically about the complexity of the direct, indirect, and interactive impact of these factors on leading within multinational organizations that operate worldwide. Considerable attention will be placed on the extensive findings of the major research effort related to global leadership, Project GLOBE, that assessed the expectations, preferences, and perceived effectiveness of a comprehensive set of leadership styles and behaviors in 3 industrial sectors in a total of 60 cultures located in all geographic regions of the world. Students will be able to use the Globe Project's framework of cultural differences and similarities related to organizational leadership to analyze specific cultural settings in terms of desired leadership approaches. Students will understand the paradoxical needs for both flexibility and consistency when attempting to lead with a global perspective. They will also be able to develop leadership approaches in their organizations that can achieve sufficient levels of both consistency across various global and cultural settings (needed for perceptions of fairness and predictability) and flexibility (necessary for adaptation to cultural and social differences). Students will also be exposed to research on the challenges faced by expatriate leaders who are given international assignments outside of their native cultures. Over the semester students will explore relevant examples, cases, and discussions that emphasize the application of psychological theory and research findings from varied cultural settings to the practice of leadership functions in global organizations and work situations. Some examples of the course material that will be addressed include: dimensions of national culture relevant for work organizations; research on the differences and similarities of preferred and effective leadership across dimensions of cultural differences; developing a global mindset and global leaders; leading multinational and culturally diverse teams; challenges of expatriate leadership assignments.","3 Credits"
"Psychology (PSY)","PSY 812","Group Leadership and Effective Decision Making","Students will examine the influence of leadership on the psychological and social processes related to effective decision making in work groups.PSY 812Group Leadership and Effective Decision Making (3) Contemporary organizations can easily suffer from an  ""information explosion"" with the ready availability of large quantities of data of possible relevance to decisions and problem-solving. Psychological research has identified numerous factors that can result in work groups' failing to make effective decisions. These factors include cognitive biases and heuristics that can be employed with little or no awareness by individuals and groups, usually to simplify information processing to make a decision quickly. They also include psychosocial factors related to how decisions are influenced by conformity, social power, and overconfidence about decision outcomes. In addition, psychological research has shown that groups do not always include effectively new information into revisions of the perceived consequences of decision alternatives. Leaders can help work groups be less influenced by such factors by use of approaches that require more in-depth processing of information and that increase group member awareness of potential biases and constraints that affect decision making. This course provides a comprehensive exploration of the psychological and social factors that underlie decision making in work groups in organizational settings, and in addition emphasizes the role that group leadership plays in making these decision processes more effective. The course focuses on the development of the students' ability to think critically about the complexity of factors that influence group decision making and the range of approaches to decision making that may be effective across various types of decisions and situational contexts. Particular attention will be paid to how group members process information related to the decision at hand and make judgments about uncertain future events. Over the semester students will be exposed to relevant examples, cases, and discussions that emphasize the application of psychological theory and research findings to the practice of leadership functions in work settings that help develop effective group decision making. Building on this knowledge, students will develop the skill to recognize and identify in specific organizational settings the cognitive and psychosocial factors that may influence information processing and decision making. They will be able to draw on these insights to develop action plans for minimizing the dysfunctional effects that certain of these factors may have on decision making, while aligning leader behaviors to support group processes that encourage decision effectiveness. Students will learn how to apply principles of in-depth information processing and evidence-based analytic processes to their own decision making.","3 Credits"
"Psychology (PSY)","PSY 813","Leadership for Creativity and Innovation","Students will examine the influence of leadership on the psychological and social processes related to developing creative ideas and implementing them within work groups and organizations.PSY 813Leadership for Creativity and Innovation (3) Organizations face continuous and strong pressures to be innovative with regard to all types of organizational functions. Creativity and innovation are not just important with regard to developing new products and services that organizations can offer to their customers, but with regard to developing more effective administrative, production, and delivery systems. At the same time individuals and groups within the organization are likely to resist change because of its inherent uncertainty and risk. Furthermore, while innovation and creativity may be strategic goals for the organization, at the same time the organization is also likely pursuing goals of efficiency, standardization, and quality that conflict with introducing change into the organization. Leaders in the organization thus face difficult paradoxes related to the achievement of multiple, conflicting goals. Organizational and work group creativity and innovation face a number of obstacles that leaders must minimize if the organization is to be successful or even survive. Leading for innovation is a critical skill in today's organizations. Students will have the opportunity to learn about the psychological and social factors that underlie creativity and innovation in work groups in organizational settings with an emphasis on the role that group leadership plays in the development and implementation of novel idea and processes. The course will focus on the development of the students' ability to think critically about the complexity of factors that influence creativity and innovation and the range of approaches to dealing with the normative resistance to change that often exists in organizations. Particular attention will be paid to how individuals and groups develop alternative potential ideas, evaluate those alternatives, and implement a novel approach to the issue at hand. Over the semester students will be exposed to relevant examples, cases, and discussions that emphasize the application of psychological theory and research findings to the practice of leadership functions in work settings that help develop and implement novel ideas. Some examples of the course material that will be addressed include: models of the creativity-innovation process within organizations; resistance to change; individual, group, and organizational factors affecting creativity; individual, group, and organizational factors affecting innovation; role of leadership in creativity and innovation; paradoxes related to concurrent need to lead for innovation and lead for efficiency; special challenges related to leading for innovation in multinational and virtual teams.","3 Credits"
"Psychology (PSY)","PSY 814","Psychology of Leading Work Groups and Teams","Students will examine the psychological and social processes related to leading work groups and teams.PSY 814Psychology of Leading Work Groups and Teams (3) The nature of work in contemporary organizations has been changing from being performed largely by individuals to being increasingly performed by work groups and teams. Furthermore, employees are often members of multiple work groups over relatively short intervals of time or even members of several work teams at one time. Add to this trend the increasing diversity of the workforce and the increasing use of work groups that are geographically and temporally distributed around the world, and the role of being an effective work unit leader is much more difficult than it was in the past. The multiple challenges that leaders face in their attempts to influence, motivate, and develop their employees require knowledge of the psychological and social factors affecting group performance and processes, and related skills in understanding the specific factors that may be relevant in a given organizational setting. This course provides a comprehensive examination of the psychological and social factors that underlie group and team processes in work and organizational settings. The course will focus on the development of the students' ability to think critically about the complexity of factors that influence group processes and the wide range of individual differences in behavior and emotions that can occur within a work group. Over the semester students will be exposed to relevant examples, cases, and discussions that emphasize the application of psychological theory and research findings to the practice of leadership functions in work settings that help develop effective work groups and positive intra- and inter-group relations. Particular attention will be paid to those factors that work unit leaders can directly create and maintain (such as developing and coaching individual employees and the intact team; recognizing effective work behaviors and motivation; task assignments and delegation of responsibility). Utilizing this method of deployment, students will be exposed to personal experiences of the instructor as well as those of other students, thereby encouraging the use of multiple approaches to analyzing situations and designing action plans. Emphasis will be placed on applying knowledge and theories to real world situations through both the use of case studies and discussion. Topics will range from basic definitional and theoretical framing, to critical evaluation of the utility of theories, as related to the students' goals as future organizational leaders.","3 Credits"
"Psychology (PSY)","PSY 815","Follower-Centric Leadership","Leadership research and theory most often focuses on leaders and what it takes for them to achieve results through others. However, some leadership research and theory takes a different approach by focusing more on followers and how leaders can empower those followers to achieve their own results. The purpose of this course is to explore these more follower-centric approaches to leading others, including transformational leadership, servant leadership, and authentic leadership.  The course will begin with an overview of follower-centric leadership in which the concept will be contrasted with more leader-centric theories such as trait theory, authoritarian leadership, transactional leadership, and charismatic leadership. The core of the course will be divided into three units, covering transformational leadership, servant leadership, and authentic leadership. The final unit of the course will provide an opportunity for students to compare and contrast the three different approaches or styles.","3 Credits"
"Psychology (PSY)","PSY 816","Dysfunctional Leadership","Students will explore the impact of negative and destructive leader behaviors including toxic leadership, abusive supervision and leader error.PSY 816Dysfunctional Leadership (3) Leaders face a variety of psychological, cognitive, social, and decision-making challenges in organizational life. Even the noblest leaders may be tempted by the opportunities and trappings afforded by influential leadership positions. It is necessary, then, to teach less experienced leaders about the potentially negative components of supervisory roles. As such, this course approaches the psychological processes surrounding the darker side of leadership, with specific foci on destructive leadership, toxic supervision, leader error and error recovery. The course will provide students with foundational information regarding psychological concepts of dark leadership with the aim of reducing the scope, frequency, and impact of negative leadership. Over the semester, students will be exposed to the causes and antecedents of negative leadership with a particular focus on multilevel influences. Students will also learn means and methods of appropriately and ethically recovering from errors. Learning objectives include providing a basic understanding of what factors cause destructive leadership and how to avoid potentially pit-falling situations. Emphasis will be placed on teaching students how to assess and identify contextual factors that may drive harmful leadership influence. By applying such understanding, students will learn to limit the effect of destructive leadership on themselves and their followers.","3 Credits"
"Psychology (PSY)","PSY 817","Psychology of Shared and Collective Leadership","Students will examine the topic of shared and collective leadership, which includes the psychological processes surrounding collective, team-based, and dyadic leadership in organizations.PSY 817Psychology of Shared and Collective Leadership (3) Given the complexity faced by leaders in organizations, it will not always be possible to operate alone as a leader. At times, it will be beneficial to share that process with one or more other individuals, hence the growing emphasis on ""we-based"" leadership. With psychology serving as the disciplinary framework for the course, students will have the opportunity to learn about the process and framework of shared leadership with the express goal of allowing them to utilize this, and similar, leadership processes in their own professional careers. The course will focus on providing a broad exploration of collective leadership. In particular, it will provide an understanding of the varying approaches to understanding and thinking about shared and collective leadership. In the investigation of course material, students will be exposed to real life examples and experiences - drawing heavily on instructor and student experiences as well as chosen case studies. Learning objectives for the course will center first on providing a foundation in the relatively new concept of ""we-based"" leadership to students. With this foundation, students will begin to apply this knowledge to understanding the conditions under which we-based approaches are most and least effective. Finally, students will be provided with a greater understanding of the contextual factors that shape the need for we-based leadership, with a focus on sustaining long-term leadership effectiveness.","3 Credits"
"Psychology (PSY)","PSY 818","Leadership Assessment and Development","Organizations use personality and other types of assessments for a variety of purposes, including employee selection, team building, and employee development. Many assessments are well-developed with extensive research to support their use for specific purposes. These assessments can add tremendous value to organizations and individuals by providing insights related to interests, traits, and other characteristics. There are also many popular personality inventories that are used for purposes that the publisher does not intend and/or that research does not support. This course will serve two primary goals. First, by educating class participants concerning the advantages and limitations of a variety of popular personality inventories and other types of assessments, students will become educated consumers, better able to make choices for themselves and their organizations concerning appropriate assessment methodologies. Second, by completing different assessments during the course, students will gain personal insights concerning their individual strengths, talents, interests, and developmental needs. Examples of the course topics that will be addressed include: an overview of leadership competency models, including models such as Bartram's Great Eight which is used in Penn State's Leadership Assessment Center; measurement issues, including topics such as reliability and validity; strengths and limitations of different assessment techniques; multi-rater feedback, including creating and administering a short feedback survey; theories underlying different approaches to measuring personality traits and styles; how to integrate different assessment sources; setting goals; and creating a professional development plan.","3 Credits"
"Psychology (PSY)","PSY 833","Ethics and Leadership: Psychological and Social Processes","Ethical decisions must be made by leaders at all levels of an organization. Thus, students in this course will have the opportunity to learn about important issues in ethical leadership that will provide a foundation of the basic principles of operating as an ethical leader in organizations. The term ""organizations"" is intentionally broadly defined and will include reference to business, non-government organizations, government entities, and non-profit entities. Specifically, students will be exposed to topics such as the role of psychological development in ethical decision making, theoretical foundations of choosing ethical pathways from the field of psychology, the role of personality and cognition in ethicality, developing and sustaining an ethical climate, ethics during crises, ethics in a global environment, and the psychological underpinnings of leading groups toward ethical ends. The course will be grounded in psychological theory, with particular emphasis on social, cognitive, and affective frameworks. Through the presentation and investigation of the course material, students will be exposed to the core principles of ethical leadership as well as a series of real-world case examples and experiences. In addition, students will share their personal experiences and work through the often challenging and difficult decisions that surround ethical leadership. These practical discussions will be couched and framed in the discipline of psychology. Such practical applications are intentional and aimed at providing a bridge between psychological theory and application. Building on these insights, the learning outcomes of the course will be to teach students to effectively and accurately assess complex leadership situations, possessing the capacity to make ethical decisions and take ethical action. Moreover, students will develop an awareness of key psychological principles guiding ethical choices and be able to apply such awareness to identify key barriers to leading ethically, with the intent of encouraging students to remove such barriers in organizations. Finally, students will possess the ability to teach others how to operate in ethically-bound ways, further enhancing the performance and sustainability of the organization.","3 Credits"

"Public Policy Analysis (PPOL)","PPOL 528","Demographic Change and Public Policy","This course will examine the interplay between demographic trends and public policies, largely in the United States. Students will be exposed to the two-way relationship between public policy and demographic change, considering both the impact of policies on demographic outcomes as well as the effect of changing demographic structures on public policy development. Demographic trends play an important role in driving public policy change, especially given the extent to which shifts in population composition emphasize different areas of public policy. Similarly, public policies have implications for outcomes related to population structure and composition, including health, life expectancy, marriage, childbearing, migration, aging, disability, and retirement. Inequality across race, ethnicity, nativity, gender, socioeconomic status, and geographic location is a common thread that runs through each of these relationships. The course provides a detailed examination of each process. The course will involve an introduction to demography and public policy and will cover topics including immigration, health policy and life expectancy, family policies, family structure and fertility, migration and immigration policy, race and racism, housing and urban policy, population aging and pensions, social policy and inequality, and climate and environmental policy.

One may be tempted to respond to this question by focusing on the money that business steers into political campaigns. Yet this approach elides a broader understanding of the influence of business on democratic self-government. This course will examine the direct participation of business in politics and public governance through private responses to ""government failures"" in the provision of goods and services. Through this involvement, business reshapes how democracy works, and we will study several mechanisms by which it does this including distributive public policy and reconceiving the citizen as a customer. Our scope is global; both individual countries and international efforts will be examined. Students will gain important analytic skills by employing frameworks from economics, political science and related disciplines, and will develop a richer understanding of the role that business plays in our political life.","3 Credits"

Is this challenge something exclusive to the United States? This course will provide students the opportunity to analyze how race and ethnicity are constructed across the globe as well as how race and politics interact across state borders. Students will examine how race is constructed and racial ideologies are developed in several countries including the U.S., South Africa, France, Australia and Brazil. By the end of the semester, students should be able to fully engage and contribute to broad literatures on the politics and policy of race and racism. They should readily be able to answer questions such as: What role do countries and their institutions play in developing racial ideologies and racial hierarchies? What political purpose do ideologies such as ""racial democracy"" serve? How might social scientists best compare notions such as U.S.'s ""race problem,"" Latin America's ""shade problem"" and Europe's ""immigrant problem""? What are the perils of cross-border comparisons, and how, if possible, can social scientists account for state differences in their analyses? The major objectives of the course are to: (1) analyze the effects of historical, social, economic, cultural and global forces on the development of racial and ethnic politics in various countries; (2) define and critically analyze concepts relevant to the study of racial and ethnic politics; (3) identify, critique and apply major academic theories and debates regarding issues of race, ethnicity, inequality and reconciliation; (4) build analytical skills so that students will be able to effectively engage and communicate in public and scholarly discourse about race and ethnic politics; (5) improve writing skills, especially as they relate to manuscript and book reviews; (6) become cognizant of the difficulties that scholars must navigate as they approach topics related to the politics, race, ethnicity as well as comparative/cross-state analysis; and (7) develop a series of best practices to address methodological and theoretical challenges to studying race comparatively.","3 Credits"
"Public Policy Analysis (PPOL)","PPOL 560","Governance, Public Values, and the Law","This course examines the design of governance structures from a values perspective. Governance structures are configurations of institutions (rules or norms) that govern the practice of public administration and the implementation of public policy. Contemporary governance includes a wide variety of such structures, from the bureaucratic hierarchies to participatory mini-publics. We explore how theories about public values - particularly democratic values - explain different ways in which governance structures help to maintain a state's commitment to those values. Our study is informed by theoretical and empirical literatures in state building and state capacity, democracy, and public administration and policy. Because governance structures have essential features that are enshrined in law, we will engage with literatures in administrative law. Because the examples of governance structures we consider are from a variety of national contexts, we will engage literatures that are cross-national and comparative, providing students with an advanced understanding of the role of governance structures in democratic societies.","3 Credits"
"Public Policy Analysis (PPOL)","PPOL 570","Environmental Policy","This course provides an overview of environmental policy, from an economic perspective, with a focus on practical applications of environmental problem solving. In this course, we will characterize environment problems and examine arguments for policy intervention. The course will cover methods including environmental policy evaluation, cost-benefit analysis, and nonmarket valuation. Policy topics covered include, but are not limited to: air, water, climate, sustainability, development, energy, and environmental justice. The class focuses on US environmental policy; however, topics of global environmental policy will be incorporated. By the end of this course, students will be able to: (1) conduct economic analysis of environmental policy issues; (2) discuss the benefits and drawbacks of commonly applied tools for environmental policy analysis and commonly used generic policies for responding to environmental challenges; (3) identify important landmarks in US environmental policy and describe the surrounding institutional conditions; and (4) communicate evidence, translate scientific findings, and argue persuasively in debates about how to respond to pressing environmental challenges","3 Credits"

"Public Policy Analysis (PPOL)","PPOL 801","The Public Policy Process","The policy process refers to the development of public policy over time and the actors, events, and contexts surrounding this development. Trying to understand and explain the policy process requires an understanding of the relationships among an uncountable number of factors in a dynamic system with nested levels of interactions and uncertain inputs and outputs. This course decomposes this complexity by first considering the political conceptualization of public policy problems, the tools by which public policies -- laws, regulations, and markets -- are expressed, and the formal and informal actors (voters, legislators, executives, courts, bureaucracies, the media, and interest organizations) engaged in the policy process. The course then examines a number of broad models of the policy process as a whole, including the policy streams, institutional, incremental, advocacy coalition, and punctuated equilibrium models. The course also examines these actors and models at several stages of the policy process running from agenda setting, through policy formulation and adoption, to policy evaluation. The goal of the course is to enable students to identify the wide variety of actors in the policy process, understand the institutional contexts they operate in and the tools of policy influence they seek to employ at several distinct stages of the policy process, and critically assess the implications and empirical veracity of a variety of conceptual models of the policy process.","3 Credits"
"Public Policy Analysis (PPOL)","PPOL 802","Economic Analysis for Public Policy","Should the government directly regulate pollution or allow the market to determine levels of effluents? Should government pay farmers to reduce production of oversupplied crops, or is this an unfair government handout? Economists approach such questions using the basic microeconomic tools of their discipline. Understanding and being able to apply those tools is an essential part of the work of public policy analysts. This course, designed for students with little or no prior training in economics, gives students an overview of the tools and logic economists use in analyzing questions like those above, as well as many others. The focus will be on gaining a sound understanding and familiarity with the basic concepts and modes of analysis used in microeconomics so they can be applied to public policy questions. This includes first a basic overview of the behavior of consumers, firms, and labor markets, and based on this, the concepts of supply and demand, competition, and consumer and producer surplus. Students will learn how these influence the functioning of markets given that they may be imperfect, including problems of imperfect information, irrational behavior, and market failures associated with externalities and public goods. And third, this course will cover how these problems both play out in the demand for government goods and services and government's production decisions, as well as how these problems might be addressed using the tools of microeconomic analysis. Students will leave this course with a better understanding of how an economist approaches many contemporary policy debates and an ability to use microeconomic analysis to assess policy problems.","3 Credits"
"Public Policy Analysis (PPOL)","PPOL 804","Public Sector Organization Theory","Public policies are more often than not designed by public sector organizations and implemented by them. To understand public policy, then, students must understand public sector organizations. Why are they designed as they are? And why do they behave as they do? Several disciplines offer often competing theories to answer these questions. This course will survey these theories to provide students with a foundation for understanding public sector organizations and how they influence public policy. After first discussing the inherent link between public sector organizations and public policy and discussing how public and private sector organizations differ, this survey will examine several theories that address the internal structure of organizations: bureaucratic, structural, human relations, contingency, and new institutional theories. Behavioral decision theory and incremental theory are then examined as the most prominent views on how organizations make decisions. External influences on organizational structure and behavior are then considered in a review of organization ecology, resource dependency, and organization economics theories. The course will then move beyond isolated organizations by addressing social capital and network theory and social movement theory. In reviewing these several theoretical perspectives, special attention will be placed on public sector organizations and the application of insights from the theories to the design and implementation of public policy. The goals of the course include developing an understanding how the different theories offer critical insights for the design and implementation of public policies","3 Credits"
"Public Policy Analysis (PPOL)","PPOL 805","Bureaucracy and the Policy Process","This course examines the role of bureaucracy in the public policy process. Bureaucracies are critical actors in the conceptualization of policy problems, formulating policy solutions, and implementing public policies, whether directly through government or via the market. Public agencies are also the locus of many public policy careers. We will analyze how public agencies and their employees at all levels of government survive and sometimes prosper within an intensely political environment. The course briefly examines the relationship between politics and policy as first developed in public administration as the politics/administration dichotomy, then via the concept of overhead democracy within political science, and finally in contemporary economics and political science via public choice theory and principal agent models. Second, to better understand this transition in approaches to understanding of bureaucracy, the course develops a working model of bureaucratic politics by examining the motivations of relevant actors and their complex political environment(s). And third, this model is employed to examine the enduring problem of political control of the bureaucracy, with emphasis on evaluating a number of alternative and competing institutional strategies designed to enhance control. This first of these strategies is via hierarchy as expressed via principal-agent analysis. After outlining the logic of agency theory, the course looks closely at the relationship between bureaucracy and political executives, legislators, courts, and non-governmental actors. This strategy of controlling bureaucracy in the policy process is then contrasted with three others: limited government, non-bureaucratic provision of services by quasi-markets, and competitive bureaucracy in which agencies are designed to compete with each other. The goals of the course are to become first broadly familiar with the issue of bureaucratic politics and then how this influences each stage of the policy process. Beyond that, the goals include an appreciation of the nature of the bureaucratic control problem and the various strategies designed to address it.","3 Credits"
"Public Policy Analysis (PPOL)","PPOL 807","Managing Public Organizations","Public policies are more often than not designed by public sector organizations and implemented by them. To understand public policy, then, students must understand public sector organizations and the people who work in them, interact with them, or are served by them. All of these influence the substantive manner in which public policy is actually implemented and the quality of that implementation. Further, many public policy analysts move into line management positions as their careers develop. How well public sector organizations are managed, then, has a significant impact on public policy outcomes and policy analyst careers. This course considers a range of management issues operative in the daily work of public sector organizations. After first discussing the inherent link between public sector organizations and public policy and discussing how public and private sector organizations differ in regard to management, this discussion considers several broad characteristics that distinguish organizations. This includes organizational structures and cultures. It then addresses the roles of leadership and strategic planning in defining the management function. And last, the course surveys a broad range of persistent management issues with a bearing on public policy: managing the civil service system, motivating employees, organizational performance, contracts and networks, and citizen involvement. More dynamically, it examines the management of conflict, change and innovation, and the political environment. The goals of the course include developing both an understanding of the internal and external influences on public sector organizations as they implement public policies and an appreciation of the range of distinct management issues that influence policy outcomes.","3 Credits"
"Public Policy Analysis (PPOL)","PPOL 808","Public Finance and Budgeting","This course provides an overview of taxation and expenditure choices made by government as essential inputs into the policy process. How big should government be? What is a good source of revenue? What is a good expenditure? The course examines and compares how different theoretical and disciplinary approaches to fiscal analysis -- economics, political science, and public administration -- answer these questions. In addition to examining the question of the overall size and growth of the public sector and the governmental institutions responsible for fiscal choices, public expenditures will be evaluated from the perspectives of public goods theory (market failure and non market failure), rational budgeting theory and the development of budget proposals, incremental theory, and democratic theory. Revenue choices will be examined through the lens of both normative tax theory on the criteria of adequacy, stability, efficiency, and equity, and positive theories of taxation that address how taxes are actually adopted and altered by governments. An understanding of tax incidence is central to several of these criteria. The course will also examine the balance of government revenues and expenditures by examining the sources, financing, and consequences of government debt and the use of capital budgets. The course will be especially attentive to how policy professionals apply these varied theoretical approaches to answering these questions. The goal of the course is to enable students to become conversant both with the many conceptual languages in which government taxation and budgeting issues are debated and to prepare them for professional positions in which revenue and expenditures are essential instruments in the formulation and implementation of public policy.","3 Credits"
"Public Policy Analysis (PPOL)","PPOL 809","Public Policy Analysis","This course provides students an overview of prospective public policy analysis as a means of informing public policy choice. That is, it examines how analysis techniques can be used to assess whether proposed policy solution are likely to solve policy problems. The scientific logic underlying formal prospective public policy analysis is discussed before turning to identifying policy problems, conceptualizing public policies from economic, organizational, and political perspectives, and identifying public policy alternatives as well as the criteria for assessing their likely policy consequences and political and organizational feasibility. Several formal methods of prospective public policy analysis are discussed, including a family of back-of-the-envelope techniques, forecasting methods, simulation methods, discounting for probability, risk, and time, cost-benefit analysis, and political and organizational analysis addressing feasibility. Such formal analyses are not, of course, the only type of information used in the policy formulation and adoption process. Thus, the limits on the role of formal analysis in the policy process are discussed along with the effective reporting of formal prospective public policy analyses.","3 Credits"
"Public Policy Analysis (PPOL)","PPOL 810","Policy and Program Evaluation","This course provides students an overview of public policy and program evaluation as a scientifically-based means of assessing whether such programs and polices are effective after they have been adopted and implemented. The scientific logic underlying evaluation research is discussed before turning to conceptualizing public policies and programs as testable hypotheses. After then reviewing measurement theory and its application to public policies and programs, the course discusses the inferential validity criteria used to assess a variety of research designs. A major portion of the course will entail an in-depth discussion of several different research designs, including their logic, implementation, strengths, and weaknesses. These will include discussions of pre-experimental, experimental, correlational, interrupted time series, regression discontinuity, comparison group, case study, and nested research designs. Ethical and other practical problems of constructing evaluation research in the field are examined. Finally, the reporting of evaluation research results along with utilization problems associated with evaluation reports are discussed. The goals of the course include enabling students to both critically interpret evaluation research reports and to design, conduct, and report evaluation studies of public policies and programs.","3 Credits"

"Research Integrity and Scholarly Ethics (RISE)","RISE 500L","Responsible Conduct of Research in Life and Health Sciences","Responsible conduct of research (RCR) is the foundation upon which science depends for rapid progress and appropriate allocation of credit for research accomplishments. In the life and health sciences there have been dramatic changes in the research environment over time that have led to high-stakes professional outcomes for research scientists: multi-million dollar research grants, high-visibility international awards, institutional prestige. Personal accomplishments are intricately tied up with these professional outcomes: career consequences (tenure, expanded research group, etc.), significant personal financial rewards (royalties, start-up companies, etc.), and personal prestige and recognition, among others. These increasing professional and personal pressures on research scientists can have very real impacts on the day-to-day decisions of scientists: appropriate data acquisition and management, proper allocation of credit, responsible use of animals, responsible work with human subjects, appropriate advising and mentoring of students, respect of intellectual property, and the avoidance of conflicts of interest and commitment. This course explores the ethical basis for the responsible conduct of research, and highlights the challenges faced by today's scientists. Students will learn about past failures in the responsible conduct of research that inform the current regulatory environment, understand the current expectations of biomedical scientists beyond the regulations, and, through the use of case studies, explore real ethical dilemmas for which there are not always easy answers.

"Rural Sociology (RSOC)","RSOC 516","Change in Rural Society","Social change in rural society, emphasizing prediction and control of the change process. Even years.  R SOC (CEDEV) 516 Change in Rural Society (3) Rural America has experienced change throughout its history, but the most rapid have occurred in the past three decades. Forces of urbanization, industrialization, technological change and globalization of the economy drive change in rural America, and the effects of these forces differ across the United States. Some rural areas benefit from the changes that occur while others are devastated. Some rural people and places are able to adapt and view change as an opportunity, while others are unable to respond to the forces that threaten them. Individuals, families and communities have changed in response to these broad forces. This becomes manifest in new patterns of inequality, family life, educational attainment, migration, age and racial patterns, health and well-being, and local service availability. Questions examined in this course include: What are the theories that explain or describe the social change that has been affecting rural people and places? What industrial restructuring and economic change has occurred in rural areas, how has it affected rural areas, and what drives this restructuring? What other social change has taken place, and can we determine potential sources of that change? What are the options available to rural people and communities as they adapt to forces of change, and how much can they influence their own futures? Underlying each of these questions is the issue of whether the well-being of rural people, families, and communities has improved or is threatened by these changes, and which rural areas are most likely to benefit and which are threatened. Students will leave the class with a broad understanding of the forces affecting rural America, and how and why those forces influence some people and places differently. Grades are assigned in this class based on a term paper on a topic related to rural social change, reaction papers written about each set of reading assignments, serving as discussion leader, and class participation.","3 Credits"

RSOC 552Theoretical Frameworks for Rural Community Research (3) Communities form the fabric of social life in rural areas. It is in these communities that individuals live and work, and experience the broader society and culture. It also is in these communities that individuals deal with the past and make decisions about their own futures. Knowing the theoretical underpinnings of communities in rural areas is crucial for understanding issues of social and economic well-being. This course examines sociological theories of community and how they relate to understanding the organization, structure, interactions and development of rural communities. Rural community theory also plays a role in understanding how community context influences individual and family well-being. In this course, students will gain an appreciation for the role of rural sociology in the study of community. They will read and evaluate theoretical essays and how the theories have been applied in empirical studies of rural communities. The goal is to increase student knowledge and understanding of the research process that links theory and hypothesis development as it relates to the study of community in rural areas. Students will enhance their skills and obtain experience in organizing and leading class discussions; reading, interpreting and integrating theoretical and empirical studies; writing a book review; and writing essays that integrate ideas from assigned materials with student evaluations of the materials.

"School Psychology (SPSY)","SPSY 556","Psychological Assessment of Preschool and School-Aged Children","Study of cognitive/affective tests; use of systems (analytic, multivariate statistical, actuarial methods of data combination) in decision-making processes.  Studies indicate that a major job function of school psychologists is the evaluation and classification of children who are thought to be exceptional. Diagnosis of learning and personal/ social problems of children is complex and highly dependent upon assessment strategies. Although individual-level diagnostic tools are still a hallmark of school psychological practice, up-and-coming professionals also need to be prepared to think through universal screening, progress monitoring, program implementation, and systems-change to support children with social-emotional problems as part of three-tiered service delivery models such as School-Wide Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports, school-based mental health, and Response to Intervention frameworks. Within this overall ""blueprint"" the course will focus on six critical areas: 1.     The evaluation of specific assessment techniques in relation to acceptable psychometric standards to include a review of universal screening, progress monitoring, and individual-level/ targeted techniques (to include lethality risk assessment including risk for harm to self or others). 2.     The statistical selection, use, and adaptation of diagnostic batteries. 3.     The use and interpretation of computer output in the evaluation of predictive validity, clinical utility, bias, and clustering of both psychological variables and children. 4.     Comprehensive case planning for social-emotional assessment in school settings and carrying out mock evaluations that emphasize social-emotional concerns for students. 5.     The use of diagnostic reports as vehicles for facilitating instructional and social-emotional goal planning for children. 6.

"Social Studies Education (SSED)","SSED 533","Research on Social Studies Education","This course examines current and influential theory and research on social studies education in the context of K-12 schools and curriculum. The field of social studies education is broad and inclusive of different disciplines and academic content that relate to the social education of learners: histories of countries, peoples, social groups, movements, and the world; historical narratives and counternarratives of identities and heritage; notions of citizenship/civic belonging, civic engagement, and social justice; politics and ideologies; media and technology; sociology and sociocultural analyses; economic development, equity, and socioeconomic analyses; geography and world cultures; globalization and globalism; place and environments; and the interplay of individuals, groups, and institutions. How is social content positioned (or neglected) in school curriculum and educational policy? How is social content taught by teachers and learned by young people? How is that learning assessed and used? What are the implications for how young people learn about the world, cultures, social phenomena, and the past? These are kinds of questions that the social studies education research field explores. This course offers an overview of the research base and significant current scholarship on social studies education. It provides students with a grounding in reading and analyzing that literature, synthesizing ideas from across bodies of research, and applying research findings and interpretations to curricular and educational work. Course activities and assignments give students exposure to critically evaluating this research and scholarship and applying research findings to educational practice, curriculum design, professional development, or future academic inquiry.","3 Credits"

Through engaging with these texts and their ideas, the student will gain stronger understanding of historical research and scholarship broadly and on particular topics to apply to history education. Works of historical nonfiction include-and often combine features from across-the following different types: - academic historiography (original historical research for specialized audiences) - public scholarship (intellectual writing for informed public audiences) - popular history (texts that don't require extensive prior knowledge for mass audiences) - narrative history (factual storytelling to inform and entertain). Focus is on learning to analyze historical nonfiction for factual evidence, claims, warrants, concepts, and interpretations that can support intellectually rigorous instruction and curriculum design. Course exercises will give the student opportunities to think about age-appropriate adaptation of complex historical content. Students will learn to synthesize conclusions from across texts to form generalizations that address compelling questions for K-12 history education..","3 Credits"
"Social Studies Education (SSED)","SSED 537","Teaching Citizenship for Civic Engagement","This course explores citizenship education for civic engagement. Lessons revolve around three essential questions culled from the research literature: What kind of citizens and civic engagement does a 21st century democracy need? What should these citizens know, believe, and be able to do? What practices, programs, and structures in educational settings promote active citizenship? Activities and written assignments work to answer each of these questions, encouraging students to grapple with competing theories of citizenship that have shaped citizenship education programs in schools and universities. Course exercises will give students opportunities to think about and weigh their commitment to different definitions and theories of democracy, civic engagement, and citizenship. Students will analyze how educators have put those definitions and theories into practice across educational settings. In analyzing how civic engagement can be fostered across the educational lifespan-from the earliest grades to university education-students should take note of commonalities in approach as well as age-appropriate differences.","3 Credits"

If, as the old sociological adage goes ""demography is destiny,"" then our destiny is educationally transformed demography.  Interdisciplinary research across demography, sociology, neuropsychology, and epidemiology is developing a strong research literature about how the thinking style, behavior, and attitudes of the educated human radically change fundamental dynamics underlying the world's population. The whole way in which we come to our jobs, spouses, and lifestyles; how many children we have and how we raise them; how long we are likely to live, and what will be our eventual demise are all heavily influenced by how much education we have had. The collective force of widespread education and its influence on rising cognitive abilities, scripts for living, and economic well-being are creating a distinctly new type of human population with major benefits and future challenges for a sustainable human population.  At the same time, individuals' schooling is also influenced by demographic change. This seminar covers key concepts, theories, and methodological issues related to the intersection of demographical and cultural changes from the education revolution and their impact on subsequent demographic processes.","3 Credits"

PL SC (SOC) 519 Survey Methods II: Analysis of Survey Data (3)This is an intermediate level course in quantitative analysis. It is intended for graduate students who have completed 1-2 semesters of graduate-level statistics (not general research methods) and who are interested in the application of social statistics to the unique aspects of data collected by way of surveys. Surveys have a combination of qualities that represent challenges to valid inference. These include cluster and stratified sampling, under-representation of some groups due to differential response rates, missing data due to item non-response, cross-sectional design, and coarse measurement. Quite often we use surveys to test theories that the original survey designer did not intend to address, raising issues of validity and reliability of measurement. At the same time, surveys offer a number of opportunities and, when combined with other surveys (pooled cross sections) or merged with contextual data, can address a wide range of theoretical puzzles in the social sciences. This course provides an introduction to techniques in applied statistics that have developed specifically to address the special features of survey data. Examples of such techniques are: use of design weights, post-stratification weights, merging surveys with other surveys or auxiliary data, missing data imputation, challenges of causal inference. The class will blend an understanding of the core statistical issues with an emphasis on acquiring an intuition for the theory underlying the statistical models rather than focusing on proofs and estimation. This will provide a foundation for frequent hands-on applications in this seminar and for enrollment in more advanced or more in-depth courses offered by the Statistics department and the various social science departments.","3 Credits"

This has raised numerous questions about the consequences of immigration and the long-term prospects of immigrants and their descendants. The major objective of this course is to provide the foundation for a sociological understanding of the process of assimilation (or incorporation), especially in relation to the structure of opportunities and the reproduction of inequality. This will be accomplished through a survey of contemporary theoretical perspectives, and both quantitative and qualitative studies that evaluate their merits. Although sociology has embraced the study of assimilation since its inception, we will also draw on other disciplines to explore various topics associated with educational attainment, economic mobility, social incorporation, political incorporation, family formation, and ethno-racial identification. Students will be evaluated on the basis of their engagement with weekly readings, as revealed by the quality of their participation in discussions and their written response to weekly essay questions. Students will also be required to write a paper on a topic of their choosing. This paper may be a research proposal, a literature review or a research study.

Students will be exposed to the two-way relationship between public policy and demographic change, considering both the impact of policies on demographic outcomes as well as the effect of changing demographic structures on public policy development. Demographic trends play an important role in driving public policy change, especially given the extent to which shifts in population composition emphasize different areas of public policy. Similarly, public policies have implications for outcomes related to population structure and composition, including health, life expectancy, marriage, childbearing, migration, aging, disability, and retirement. Inequality across race, ethnicity, nativity, gender, socioeconomic status, and geographic location is a common thread that runs through each of these relationships. The course provides a detailed examination of each process. The course will involve an introduction to demography and public policy and will cover topics including immigration, health policy and life expectancy, family policies, family structure and fertility, migration and immigration policy, race and racism, housing and urban policy, population aging and pensions, social policy and inequality, and climate and environmental policy.

Educational and economic status are considered, along with such factors as family structure, geographical location, residential segregation, language, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Institutional patterns that potentially contribute to observed statuses are reviewed. Two groups of African Americans receive special attention: the urban ""underclass"" that sits at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder and middle class blacks. Consideration of economic stratification by race and ethnicity includes analysis of wealth disparities and the differences in life chances they create. Structural and cultural explanations of economic outcomes are contrasted. Patterns of economic assimilation shown for recent immigrants are outlined, and the notion of ""segmented assimilation"" is introduced. Economic interdependence among minority groups receives attention. Extensive recent evidence about employment discrimination is reviewed. The relevance of white Americans' racial attitudes to political opinions and policy outcomes receives attention in readings that focus on policy issues affecting both African Americans and American Indians. Classic and recent frameworks for understanding prejudice and discrimination are introduced. Patterns observed for African American targets are contrasted with those for Latinos and Asian Americans. Research on the outcomes of intergroup contact is reviewed, along with recent ""contextual"" studies that assess the influence of community characteristics on racial attitudes. Racial/ethnic identity is put in the spotlight, with attention to African Americans but also American Indians, West Indian immigrants, Latinos, Asian Americans, multiracial groups, and white Americans. ""Pan-ethnicity"" is considered.

However, the historical development and continuity of the major questions that have guided urban research receive more than passing attention, as do the contributions of geographers, psychologists, and others outside the discipline. A broad range of theoretical perspectives, substantive topics, and methodological strategies are through reading, lecture, and discussion. Students are expected to be active, critical consumers of urban knowledge but also producers of it: they must independently formulate and address a research problem then share their results with their classmates. Once students complete Sociology 560, they should be ready to enroll in more specialized urban seminars and to teach urban sociology at the undergraduate level.","3 Credits"
"Sociology (SOC)","SOC 572","Foundations in Causal Analysis in the Social Sciences","Methods for estimating causal effects in observational data, including matching, counterfactual, and related approaches.SOC 572Foundations in Causal Analysis in the Social Sciences (3) This course investigates methods for estimating causal effects in observational (non-experimental) data. There are three common strategies for estimating causal effects in observational data. One strategy is to condition on variables to block all the back-door paths from the causal variable to the outcome variable. Examples: matching (including propensity scores) and regression with control variables. A second strategy is to use exogenous variation to isolate the ""unconfounded"" covariation in the causal and outcome variables. Examples: instrumental variables (IVs), natural experiments, fixed effects. A third strategy is to isolate the mechanisms through which the causal variable operates to affect the outcome variable. These methods are becoming more standard in sociology and related fields. The course will cover the following methods: standard regression and its limitations; natural experiments and instrumental variables; counterfactual or potential outcomes methods; matching methods, including propensity scores; fixed-effects and random-effects; structural equation methods; mixed methods. The course is distinguished from other courses in the university by its focus on the use of statistical methods for causal inference. Whereas other courses describe regression or structural equation models as general methods for one's statistical toolkit, this course concentrates on when, and how, regression or structural equation approaches can be used to draw causal inferences from non-experimental data. Examples will be drawn from a variety of social science disciplines, including economics, political science, and criminology, as well as from sociology.","3 Credits"

Multilevel data arise when cases are sampled at two or more levels, with each lower level subsumed within the next higher, such as residents within neighborhoods within cities or individuals within families. Such data almost always violate the independence assumption of ordinary least squares regression, and in recent years a wealth of more appropriate techniques have become available. These methods bring the full flexibility of multiple regression analysis to the analysis of multilevel data, enabling scholars to address a broad range of research questions. This course thoroughly covers the basic multilevel regression model and also devotes considerable time to more advanced topics such as analysis of data with three or more levels, multilevel analysis of discrete dependent variables, and latent variables. Students will study examples in a broad range of substantive domains, with special attention to the unique research questions to which these methods give access. This is a course in the application of statistics to social science research, not a theoretical statistics course. Therefore the course will not include derivations and proofs, but rather the mathematics covered will be in the service of defining statistical models that correspond to useful research questions. The emphasis will be on understanding how to use these methods to do good research and on learning to interpret the results they provide. Several class sessions will be held in computer laboratories in order to train students in the use of statistical software that implements these methods.","3 Credits"

ANTH (SOC) 579 Spatial Demography (3)The improved application of spatial data and methods to demographic research is a critical methodological challenge facing demographers today. This graduate seminar is designed to focus on substantive demographic research topics while exposing sociologists and demographers to challenges in, and opportunities for, using geographic information systems (GIS), spatial analysis, and spatial statistics in their own research. Substantive foci will include readings and discussions of spatial perspectives on topics such as racial/ethnic segregation, spatial mismatch/entrapment, poverty, crime/delinquency, migration, health inequalities, wellbeing, maternal and child health, environmental justice, and population and environment relations. Similarly, the seminar will highlight connections between spatial concepts and data availability (e.g., Modifiable Areal Unit Problem - MAUP; data privacy), other emerging methodological approaches to studying society (e.g., contextual modeling, multi-level modeling and the area of neighborhood effects) as well as the integration of different types of data (e.g. qualitative data and quantitative data). Throughout the course lectures and discussions will be complemented with lab sessions introducing spatial analysis methods and GIS and spatial analysis software. The lab sessions will include the use of among other software GeoDa, CrimeStat, R, and ArcGIS (including Geostatistical Analyst and Spatial Analyst extensions). These lab sessions will introduce many methodological and technical issues relevant to spatial analysis (e.g., error, data validation, data integration, cartography, exploratory spatial data analysis, spatial regression modeling, geographically weighted regression, point pattern analysis and geostatistics). Assignments for the courses include up to two writing assignments, up to four lab assignments, and a final project which will be presented as a short 15-minute presentation as well as submitted as a term paper. The writing assignments will include an annotated bibliography/brief literature review within a selected demographic theme area and a profile of a well-known demographer and their adoption of spatial thinking/perspectives/methods. The lab assignments will focus on building geospatial databases, basic spatial analysis, exploratory spatial data analysis, and spatial regression modeling. The courses will include other labs and assignements that will be completed for no grade; these are inteded as mechanisms/opportunities for developing and enhancing familiarity with selected software, data resources, and analytic methods.","3 Credits"
"Sociology (SOC)","SOC 580","Social Network Analysis","Methods of social network analysis used to examine patterns of ties among actors in a social system. This course provides an overview of the analytic methods and conceptual perspective of a social network approach to social science research, with a focus on quantitative methods. Social network analysis is used to examine patterns of ties between multiple actors in a social system, where the actors could be individuals, dyads, groups, organizations, or nation-states. There has been a dramatic rise in the application of such an approach to research from a broad range of researchers over the past decade. A social network approach is applicable to several subfields within sociology, such as social psychology, demography, criminology, organizations, and the family. The course objectives are to: 1) become familiar with the basic elements of social network analysis and recognize situations where this approach may be useful; 2) develop an appreciation for the conceptual perspectives behind this modeling approach; 3) learn about the strengths and limitations of network models and analyses; 4) apply social network analysis to empirical data and interpret findings, and finally: 5) complete a research paper that applies this approach to data regarding a social science problem. Network topics covered include centrality, clustering and cliques, triads and transitivity, weak ties, structural equivalence, and network visualization. In addition, students will be introduced to advanced topics, such as exponential random graph models, and dynamic SIENA models. Students should have completed two semesters of social statistics at the graduate level or equivalent before enrolling in this course.","3 Credits"

The course emphasizes learning by doing. We begin by writing reviews of anonymous manuscripts that have been submitted to journals for possible publication. We ask four key questions about each article: What do we like about the manuscript (strengths)? What do we dislike (weaknesses)? What suggestions do we have - substantive and stylistic - for revising the manuscript? Is it published? Class discussion is organized around those questions. Then we use the same format and tools to critique unpublished student manuscripts. We discuss each manuscript with a view to answering the question of how the manuscript needs to be revised to make it publishable. Finally we read key articles on the differences between journal writing, book writing, and the writing of grant proposals. Again students are given hands-on experience by reviewing book prospectuses and grant proposals. The course is designed to be a core course in the Sociology Department's Professional Development Module for Ph.D. students. The specific goals of the course are: A publishable paper - or at least concrete suggestions for how to make a student manuscript publishable, or book precis competitive, grant proposal fundable. A better understanding of how the review process works - what happens after you submit your paper, precis, or research proposal; what to expect from the editor's decision letter. A better understanding of what editors and reviewers are looking for in a journal manuscript, book precis, or grant proposal, and a better understanding of how to respond to reviewers' criticisms when you are invited to resubmit a manuscript or grant proposal. Good reviewing skills - what a good review looks like, and how to go about writing one. An expansion of students' intellectual horizons through exposure to different substantive areas, methodologies, and styles of work. Students will be evaluated on the basis of their written reviews due each week. The course will be offered at least twice every three years. Course enrollment should be limited to 12, to enable full in-class discussion of each student's manuscript.","3 Credits"

In the lectures, students learn good laboratory practices, sampling and sample processing and preparation methods, selection of analytical instruments and the chemical and/or physical principles exploited during the measurement, how the instrument performs the measurement and some of the techniques used to increase accuracy, precision, sensitivity, selectivity, and measurability. In the laboratory, students will put the theory and principles into practice by performing various analytical experiments designed to provide examples of the usefulness of selected instruments or techniques in a way that will enable the student to understand and operate a wide range of other related instruments for soil ecosystem analyses. Thus, while the laboratory experiments and demonstrations will illustrate some of the applications of the instruments, students will be expected to develop a deep understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of different instrument analytical techniques in terms of their usability, sensitivity, cost, and other parameters with emphasis on the applicability and complementarity of different techniques to soil ecosystem chemical measurements.","3 Credits"

Focus will be on syntax, phonology, lexicon, discourse, and pragmatics. Specific topics covered include the following: null-subjects, clicits; movement and word order, tense and aspect, mood, agreement features, grammaticalization, modality, negation, functional categories, tutored vs. untutored learners, UG vs. non-UG effects, the Noun Phrase Accessibility Hierarchy, markedness, cohesive devices, speech acts, metaphors, idioms, the lexicon and culture, the phonological systems, including suprasegmentals.In addition to developing an understanding of the current research on the acquisition of Spanish as a second language, students will learn how to read the research literature from a critical perspective and how to read empirical data presented in published research that might result in alternative interpretations from those espoused by authors of published work. This goal will be achieved in two ways: requiring students to submit via e-mail to the professor and other students in the seminar two- to three-page critiques of assigned readings; and oral presentations in class of readings selected by the student(s). Some of the critical reports and presentations will be carried out jointly, and others will be done individually.Students will also learn how to design and implement empirical research on the acquisition of Spanish as well as how to write up the results of this research in a potentially publishable research report.Finally, they will have the opportunity to present their research findings to the Penn State applied linguistics community, in a mini in-house workshop at the end of the course. In preparation for this, time will be set aside near the end of the seminar for students to present and discuss their research with their colleagues in the course.Most of the readings for the course will be preselected by the professor; however, students will also be expected to carry out independent reading of publications not included in the course syllabus and present and critique what they read in the seminar.","3 Credits"

Reflecting trends in the field, linear and logistic mixed effects regression will be a major focus in addition to more well-known (e.g. ANOVA, multiple regression, chi-square) techniques. We will also spend some time exploring other methods such as multidimensional scaling, generalized additive modeling, and conditional inference trees, as well as more specialized techniques (e.g. drift-diffusion modeling). A more important goal is to learn to think critically about quantitative data and how we can learn from it. This includes a critical view of quantitative research in general, questions of measurement, the many decisions involved in analytic strategy, model structure and interpretation, and the ability to extend students' knowledge to new techniques independently.","3 Credits"

This course provides a foundation in U.S. Latina/o Studies Literature and its contexts, with two separate but related goals. The first is to get a grasp on the U.S. Latina/o Studies canon that integrates humanities and social science approaches in order to analyze critical historical contexts that have shaped the emergence and evolution of the field of Latina/o Studies in U.S. higher education and academia, such as early colonial enterprises in the South and the Southwest, Spanish and U.S. imperialism, the Chicano and Young Lords movements during the 1960s, immigration patterns from the Caribbean and Latin America, government policies towards Latinos, contemporary rural and urban movements, etc. The second goal is to explore systematically pedagogical theories and practices in Latina/o Studies and critical race scholarship more broadly, in order for students to become conversant in the theoretical debates that underlie the design of curriculum and classroom practice in Latina/o Studies at the undergraduate level. The course will incorporate some of the major lines of research in Latina/o Studies from different disciplines (such as History, Anthropology, Ethnic Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and Linguistics) in order to address some of their most relevant discussions, internal critical debates, and major schools of thought. Students will also engage with other forms of cultural production, including visual culture, theater and performance, and music, among others. The seminar will provide graduate students a solid foundation in the development of a very timely and marketable research and teaching minor.","3 Credits"
"Spanish (SPAN)","SPAN 572","Translation in the Americas","This course provides a broad exploration of translation in the Americas. In particular, it investigates the politics, practices, and theories of translation in Latin America and the United States from the late nineteenth century to the early twenty-first century, which allows for a comparative mode of reading across and between borders of language, nation, and region. The following questions will guide our readings and discussions over the course of the semester: How does translation unfold as a metaphor, a linguistic act, and a cultural experience in the Americas? To what extent do processes of translation inform the exchanges of languages, peoples, and cultures within and between nations in this region? The class examines the role of canonical Latin American writers as translators and scholars in order to underscore the centrality of translation to the production, circulation, and reception of Latin American literature. The course analyzes the contributions of Latin American writers, including José Martí, Brazilian modernists, Jorge Luis Borges, concrete poets Augusto and Haroldo de Campos, Octavio Paz, and Julio Cortázar, to discussions of translation by reading their works on translation as theory and practice alongside key essays in translation studies by, among others, Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, Gayatri Spivak, Lawrence Venuti, and Emily Apter. It also considers the importance of translators like Gregory Rabassa, Suzanne Jill Levine, and Elizabeth Bishop in disseminating Latin American literature within the United States. Building on these insights, students will consider the recent phenomenon of Latin American literature in translation and re-translation to recognize translation as a linguistic and aesthetic challenge governed by, in part, the political and economic demands of the global, literary market.","3 Credits"

"Special Education (SPLED)","SPLED 540","Orientation to PhD Study in Special Education","Information and skills needed for successful completion of Ph.D. study in Special Education for those targeting academic careers.SPLED 540Orientation to PhD Study in Special Education (3) Offered every fall semester, this course is for students new to Ph.D. study in Special Education to prepare them for Candidacy and initiation of a line of research. Students take the course during their first semester in the Program. Based upon special offerings and typical numbers of new Ph.D. students in Special Education the anticipated enrollment will be 5-7 students. The course is intended to provide students frequent feedback on development of basic search skills and skills related to conducting a systematic review of professional literature, a skill that is prerequisite to development of a research agenda. At this point in their development, students are not expected to be able to formulate experimental research questions or use the IRB. They are still at a point at which they need to develop their skills reading and synthesizing current literature as a foundation for future experimental efforts (development of hypotheses, experimental designs, and IRB approvals are all covered in later courses). Students will receive feedback from the instructor and from peers as well as provide it to peers thereby developing their own feedback and editing skills (students actually receive feedback on their feedback). Towards the end, they need to be able to recognize varying forms of literature reviews (differing purposes and methods) and developing a means for conducting their own reviews in a systematic, replicable manner. They need to work on technical writing skills and on organization and using APA style. To accomplish this requires a lot of discussion and analysis of work in separate stages of development of a review. Generally the content includes basic information and skills needed for successful completion of Ph.D. study including: Campus resources, pitfalls, technical writing skills, setting a research agenda (research to practice issues) and conducting systematic reviews of professional literature. While this may not sound like much, it is important to note that this is a highly individualized course with an emphasis on skill development. Therefore, as a result of participation students will: (1) become acclimated to PSU information resources, (2) identify ways to keep on track during PhD study, (3) identify local support networks, (4) locate 3 systematic reviews of the professional literature and identify key features, (5) identify 3 key issues in research to practice in Special Education, (6) complete electronic searches for references on a topic assigned by the course instructor, (7) write an 18-22 page, systematic review (which will include introduction, methods, results, and discussion/implications sections), of the literature on a topic assigned by the instructor and based upon search results, (8) practice formulating ""good"" (i.e., answerable) research questions, (9) distinguish between plagiarism and appropriate citation of other works, (10) refine technical writing skills (including using APA style), (11) develop feedback/editing skills in the area of technical writing, and (12) prepare an oral presentation of their results complete with visuals. Methods of evaluation are primarily subjective and will include both peer and instructor assessments. Peer feedback during the development of the systematic review will not carry weight toward a final grade although the instructor will provide feedback to peers on their feedback to each student. The instructor's feedback will largely be individual and in writing and orally in private meetings with each student as the review is conducted in steps (e.g. introduction, results, etc.). Instructor's feedback will include areas related to technical writing in Special Education such as correct APA format, organization, substantiating claims, analysis and synthesis skills, and providing solid rational for the effort.","3 Credits"

This seminar has two goals: 1) to cover the nuts and bolts of preparing and teaching a theatre course, and 2) to do so in a way that proceeds from personal artist/citizen values. These two goals can be difficult to reconcile. Many if not most theatre instructors learn from key teachers of practice who teach the skills they know. This is one necessary dimension of teaching-imparting knowledge-but this course stretches the idea of teaching beyond this idea. The goal of this course is for students to discover how they fit into the field as a teacher and scholar, and how they might develop a portfolio of materials to be a successful job candidate and a successful teacher.","3 Credits"

Such changes require that instructional designers modify and, when necessary, use new theories and models to be more responsive and effective in meeting organizational needs for learning and performance improvement systems. Introductory graduate courses in instructional systems design typically use traditional models of instructional design to teach graduate students the fundamentals of the design process. This is necessary so that students have a solid foundation of concepts and principles to guide their practice in instructional design. This course,TRDEV 528, immerses students in the instructional systems design literature for the purpose of advancing their knowledge of more contemporary theories, models, and research of instructional systems design as students also engage in a real-world instructional design project. The process of individual and group reflection on recent research and theoretical developments in instructional systems design as students grapple with the demands and challenges of a real-world design project will broaden and deepen their expertise in the instructional systems design, thereby producing instructional designers who are more prepared to responsively and effectively address complex learning and performance improvement needs in organizations.","3 Credits"

Within the context of solid communications theory, students will have opportunities to develop or strengthen a personal delivery style, applying theoretical constructs to accentuating their strengths. Through readings, discussion, critique of exemplars, practice presentations, and feedback, students will become facile with identifying theory in use, and develop the skills required to effectively deliver content. In the increasingly complex world, there is a persistent need for and value in face-to-face presentations and the skills required to produce and deliver them are paramount in a range of organizational circumstances including but not limited to what is considered formal training. Increasingly, these skills are being called into service to support content delivery in virtual settings, and although the basic approaches are consistent philosophically, these settings require special consideration.

It draws on theory and practice from a range of traditions such as adult learning, psychotherapy, group dynamics, action research, and group process consulting to inform unique and flexible approaches to goals that are often unstructured and connected to problem resolution, innovation, and social action. Rather than teach or conduct action, facilitators support the group as members work together to achieve their goals, creating a space for the work without interjecting their own opinions or agenda. Facilitators remain sensitive to myriad real-time details, member participation and group dynamics, the roles of power and culture, and the need for a balance between action and reflection in the work of the group. Good facilitators relinquish control of the group in ways that foster open, balanced dialogue and a spirit of play among group members, building members' capacity for work on subsequent issues and opportunities. Students will actively explore the process of facilitation from the inside out, including facilitator self-awareness, goal and role clarity, developing psycho-social spaces, group process, power, and risk-taking, in both face to face and virtual settings. The course will combine opportunities to actively experiment with applied facilitation both face-to-face and online with feedback, self-reflection, and scholarly research.","3 Credits"

"Visual Studies (VSTUD)","VSTUD 555","Visualizing Gender","This course analyzes how gender identities relate to the creation, use, and analysis of visual artifacts and bodily practices. Visual texts condition and are conditioned by intersectional embodiments of gender. In an attempt to understand and critically evaluate the role visual culture plays in our gendered lives as a dominant conduit of knowledge and identity production, this seminar examines visual processes and objects as they are informed and shaped by a nexus of gender, race, sexuality, class, nationality, and other forms of identity. The visualization of gendered forms of identity involves codes that produce bodies as signifiers of chaos, order, beauty, disease, nature, culture, evil, and virtue, including actions bisected according to binaries of masculinity and femininity. The seminar employs analytical approaches to these dynamics, including feminist, queer, and critical race theories of the visual as ways of interrogating a range of visual artifacts and bodily practices. After surveying key foundational texts, the course predominantly engages contemporary works and practices along complex gender matrices, including new directions in visual culture from the 1990s onward.","3 Credits"

"Visual Studies (VSTUD)","VSTUD 557","Authors and Artists","This course explores formal and historical links between literature and art in modernist movements. ""Ut pictura poesis"" (like painting [is] poetry). This statement, originally articulated by the ancient Roman poet Horace, has been quoted and debated ever since. Links between art and literature have exerted a formative influence on the development of modern fiction and poetry as authors and artists in various avant-garde groupings collaborated and competed to generate modes of artistic expression appropriate to modernity. This course examines those interactions. Course objectives are to bring together for comparative examination: -    formal or generic relationships between texts and images at particular historical moments. -     issues of creative collaboration and cross-pollination between writers and artists, which have been crucially important in the history of literature and poetry. -     conceptions of creativity as these have been expressed by writers using the figure of the artist.

"Women's Studies (WMNST)","WMNST 525","Trans of Color Critique","A history of transgender struggle has fomented intellectual formations that interrogate racial and gendered logics and proffer alternative structures of engagement, but commitment to any conceptualization of trans critique has often fallen back on assumptive ascriptions to non-racial analysis. Gathered at the concomitant study of race, gender, sexuality, class, and socio-spatiality, Trans of Color Critique provides an opportunity to (re)consider the analytical and material possibilities and tensions tendered by the articulation of transgender and non-white. Engaging with trans (and queer) of color theory as a particular approach to the political and as its own mode of knowledge production, we will not only take up the mutual constitution of race and gender, but center how whiteness has come to construct the burgeoning field of trans studies. In this graduate seminar we will consider the ways in which these multiply marginalized knowledges aim a critical challenge at our Western knowledge traditions. The course considers how race as a modality of analysis and trans of color critique as a praxis can in turn amplify, extend, and complicate the framework and analytical interventions offered by trans studies. Rather than attempt to be exhaustive, we will focus on the urgent interventions offered by trans of color critical theory, especially as it relates to foundational disruptions of Western epistemologies, medicalization, humanism, movement and displacement, decolonial critique, carcerality, violence and death, and futurity.","3 Credits"
