Beyond close reading of primary texts from the era, students assume roles, from Cardinals and Jesuits to members of the Medici family, the Italian scientist Federico Cesi and, of course, Galileo himself.

Their debates provide resources to understand and contribute to contemporary political and constitutional debates, and they model how intellectually deep, and morally serious, public discourse can be.

Reliance on any one disciplinary set of tools and skills is useful, of course, but the real challenges of any liberal democracy are met by neither technocratic nor bureaucratic solutions. They require an awareness of the relevance of ethics, politics and economics, as well as an appreciation for the limitations of each and the necessity of thinking through their interactions."

CAS 501,Fundamentals of Complex Systems Science: Evolution,Complex Adaptive Systems,3,"The enormous diversity of biological, social and technological systems is the product of evolution. As Darwin put it poetically: 'There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved.' In short, complexity is the product of evolutionary processes. This, in turn, implies that understanding complexity requires us to understand its evolutionary origins. This course is a comprehensive introduction to the evolutionary history of complex systems and the principles and mechanisms that guide this dynamic. Covers the consequences of evolutionary history of complex systems, such as vulnerability to failure or limits of the potential of these systems to change and adapt."
CAS 502,Fundamentals of Complex Systems Science: Computation,Complex Adaptive Systems,3,"Most if not all fields of research rely on computers and an increasing number of researchers employ computational methods to collect or analyze data. Coding is found more and more often as a tool in the researcher¿s toolbox. This is especially true when modeling and studying complex systems.

CAS 503,Fundamentals of Complex Systems Science: Collectives,Complex Adaptive Systems,3,"From neurons in a brain to fish in a school to people in an economy, collectives are all around us. These are complex systems in which we understand in some detail how the individual components behave and interact, but the behavior we are interested in is at the larger scale of the aggregate. The behavior of systems like these is challenging to predict and understand largely due to the sheer number of interacting components, as well as the unintuitive way that contributions from individuals scale up to have large collective effects. Complex systems science has developed an array of conceptual tools to help understand collective behavior. Explores these foundational concepts, including emergence, scaling laws, dynamical modes and coarse-graining. Uses these tools to de-mystify powerful aggregate-scale effects, from impressive feats of swarm intelligence to potentially harmful instabilities and hysteresis."

Upon completion, students should feel confident incorporating networks and their associated complexity into their research and worldview."
CAS 522,Methods for Complex Systems Science: Dynamical Systems,Complex Adaptive Systems,3,"Focuses on the mechanisms through which complexity emerges in evolving and dynamical network architectures. Some of the best-known examples include gene expression networks, adaptive ecological networks, and neural networks for cognitive information processing. Complex systems theory deals with dynamical systems with a large number of interacting variables. Therefore, after an introduction to graph and network theory, the course covers the basic concepts of dynamical systems theory: continuous and discrete systems, attractor dynamics, bifurcation, and chaos. After introducing information theory, devoted to the fundamentals, the second part focuses on applications, especially to network dynamics. Students acquire familiarity through the analysis of concrete examples of both deterministic and random dynamics in the form of Boolean networks and random walks."
CAS 523,Methods for Complex Systems Science: Statistics and Dimensionality Reduction,Complex Adaptive Systems,3,"Because complex systems involve a large number of interacting components, observational studies of these systems typically generate data sets of high dimension. Examples include the hundreds or thousands of distinct neurons in a brain, genes in a cell, people in a society, firms in an economy, or texts in a corpus. To make sense of such data, a diverse set of data analytic tools has been developed to summarize key properties at the population level (statistics) and characterize predictable lower-dimensional patterns (dimensionality reduction). Provides a guided tour of such tools most relevant to complex adaptive systems. With a solid foundation in inferential statistics, students encounter PCA-type linear projections, nonlinear manifold techniques, topic modeling, clustering methods, network statistics, as well as more abstract foundations for how these methods work and when they fail. Students hone their data skills by applying state-of-the-art open-source software to real-world datasets."
CAS 540,Socioecological Complex Systems,Complex Adaptive Systems,3,"We live in a world that is neither wholly human nor wholly natural. Human decisions and actions combine with biological processes and physical forces transform cities, rural landscapes, ecosystems and biogeography, river systems, coastlines and the atmosphere. By emphasizing the importance of networks and feedbacks, complexity science is especially helpful in providing insight into the complex interactions between the human and natural components of the socioecological systems that are so critical to our lives and wellbeing. Examines key concepts for understanding socioecological system dynamics from a complex systems perspective. Explores how methods drawn from complexity science can trace the complex web of feedbacks between social, biological and geophysical processes and help to better understand and plan for change and stability in socioecological systems. Also looks at how complexity science can help contribute to relevant policy and governance for SES."
CAS 541,Complex Urban Systems,Complex Adaptive Systems,2 - 3,"Despite occupying only a tiny fraction of the world's area, cities house over half of earth's human population, consume over two thirds of global energy, and emit over 70% of global CO2 emissions. It is estimated that the combined ecological footprint of earth's urban areas already exceeds the entire area of our planet, and still globally 3 million more people migrate to cities every week. Cities are also the global engines of innovation, wealth creation, and production efficiencies. Thus, cities are both drivers of unsustainable behavior and our best hope for innovating sustainable solutions. Examines key concepts for understanding the complexity of urban systems, and explores how methods drawn from complexity science can be applied to urban structures and dynamics to better understand both past and future outcomes. Shows how complexity science might contribute to relevant policy and governance of cities and whether such a contribution is advisable."

Sustainability as a problem of complexity explores in a systematic way the interconnected nature of sustainability challenges and presents a complex systems science-based framework for developing sustainability solutions.
CAS 543,Complexity Economics,Complex Adaptive Systems,3,"Complexity economics is the study of economic systems as evolving, complex systems. These systems consist of interacting individuals who perceive their environments, and take actions based on multiple criteria, which in turn affect their environments and the decisions available to other individuals. Complexity economics is not an extension of conventional, neo-classical economic theory and practice, which is based on the concepts of equilibrium, optimization and aggregation. Complexity economic attempts to understand economic phenomena through concepts of evolution, emergence, path dependency and the interdependent relationships between heterogenous individuals whose actions shape their environments. This offers a new basis for theory and practice that better reflects not only real problems and scenarios, but also how individuals make decisions and how those decisions have consequences for both the environment and society."
CAS 544,Innovation in Complex System,Complex Adaptive Systems,3,"Innovation is a central property of complex systems. Without innovation there would be no evolution of complex systems. Explores the dynamics of innovation in complex systems across a number of different domains, including biological, social, cultural and technological innovations.

CAS 546,Bio-Inspired AI and Optimization,Complex Adaptive Systems,3,"Provides a survey of a variety of algorithms for optimization and multiagent control that are inspired by natural systems. Algorithms inspired by biological or physical systems can often be viewed as idealized models of those antecedent systems. Consequently, also explores potential problems (and solutions) in these algorithms that are analogous to fundamental but less well-known issues in the biological and physical systems that inspire them."
CAS 570,Fundamentals of CAS Science,Complex Adaptive Systems,3,"Many phenomena of critical relevance to human society are dynamic systems that change over individual and evolutionary time scales, and are highly interactive, both within and between systems. That is, they are complex adaptive systems (CAS), and thus share isomorphic properties like near-decomposability, hierarchical organization, scale-free networks, self-organized criticality, and emergence. Fundamentals of CAS science explores the diverse, interdisciplinary applications of a complex adaptive systems across the social, behavioral, and life sciences."
CAS 571,Applications of Complex Adaptive Systems,Complex Adaptive Systems,3,"Exposes students to the diversity of ways in which complex adaptive systems science (CASS) concepts and methods are being applied in research settings and beyond the academy.

Students develop a unique style and voice through illustration for costume."
COS 236,Costume Design I,Costume,3,"The art of costume design is a multifaceted discipline that hinges on research as much as creative development and construction. Provides an opportunity to explore the costume design process, from concept development through sample exploration, and finally the execution of fully constructed costumes. Using a sample script and characterization, students design into multiple different genres of production to gain a diverse understanding of the unique challenges of costume design. Is the production based in present day? Is it the past or the future? Post-apocalyptic or rom-com? These are the questions students face throughout the course. Additionally, there are supplemental projects shaped around sourcing, a pivotal aspect of the costume industry.

COS 317,Costume Sourcing,Costume,3,"A costume buyer or sourcing specialist in the costume industry sources materials and supplies for costumes. They work with costume designers to ensure that the materials meet the designer's vision and the production budget. The buying and sourcing process for costume production considers inventory, sizing, assortment and quantity planning in the context of the production schedule and budget. A costume buyer closely collaborates with costume designers and is responsible for purchasing fabrics, threads and other necessary items as well as renting or buying pre-made garments, all based on the costume designer's sketches. This role requires a keen eye for detail, strong organizational skills and the ability to source and secure materials that meet the designer's creative vision while adhering to budgetary constraints. In this course, students develop the unique creative and practical skills of this collaborative role that contributes to the overall look and feel of a production."
COS 335,Costume in Concept,Costume,3,"In preparation for the television and film industry, covers digital illustration and design with a directed focus on building a costume design portfolio. Students develop a character- or narrative-appropriate background and digitize and integrate costume design illustrations, flats, research and visuals from their character development process. Culminates in a portfolio review and critique by costume design industry professionals and director of the department."
COS 336,Costume Design II,Costume,3,"Furthering the exploration into the costume design process, this serves as a studio-based, hands-on experience, where learners gain a comprehensive knowledge of advanced research and construction techniques used to bring costume concepts to life. Costume design must consider many different variables including time period, environment, socioeconomic status, personality and much more in regard to bringing a character to life. Often costumes can be characters in their own right when it comes to the story telling of a given production. Designers and makers must employ techniques to create, embellish and fabricate in ways that help tell the character's story.  Learners gain the knowledge necessary to create a base costume and then transform it visually with a consideration for materials that fall beyond the scope of traditional fashion. For example, the art of aging and using unconventional surface treatments could recreate historical embroidery, or that same technique could be used to achieve futuristic textile textures. Students create costumes for various genres and productions, with an emphasis on finishing details, structure and silhouette, as well as surface embellishments."
COS 342,Costume Materials and Techniques,Costume,3,"Focuses on inventive approaches to the development and realization of textiles and surface manipulation for creative costume design and making. Students in this mixed-media course learn about a full spectrum of materiality from craft processes to cutting edge bio-materials.

Studies that examine such communicative acts in their local contexts reveal that literate practices and the texts that are produced are imbued with social and cultural values and traditions and the needs and desires of individuals.

Bearing in mind that writers tend to make their writing lives while also doing other things--to pay the rent, to enrich the writing--this course foregrounds the interdisciplinary skills fostered by (and necessary to) a life in creative writing. Focuses on the potential relationship between writing and the visual arts. Studies multi-genre works in order to see the flexible, critical, cross-disciplinary aspects of the field and to absorb new strategies from another angle of approach. Given the increasingly image-saturated nature of 21st-century life, this particular nexus (visual and literary, image and text) seems especially relevant. In a recent lecture, Airea Dee Matthews, winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets, author most recently of 'Bread and Circus,' and leader in visio-textual poetics, suggested we are already in the future that the Futurists of the early 20th century predicted, where we are being 'trained to be the eye of the machine'--as well as passive purveyors of whatever the machine doles out to us. (Think: social media.) She passionately argues that only through visio-textual work can any artist fully engage a contemporary audience and draw them beyond the surfaces of our pervasive visual culture and into the 'logical, emotional and political spheres of subjectivity' necessary to connection and communication. Hybrid works permit the coexistence of both lyric stillness and visual or digital discursiveness (i.e., fluidity/expansiveness), potentially offering clarity of thought in the midst of layers of observation, stimulation and paradox. How does writing anchor and deepen our experience and how does it help us to understand visual arts strategies and effects?"
